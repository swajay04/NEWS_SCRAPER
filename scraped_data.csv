us,Alaska Department of Transportation,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/us/alaska-wrangell-landslide/index.html,"       Three people have been found dead, including a young girl, and others are still missing after a large landslide covered a highway near a remote community in southeast Alaska on Monday, according to the state’s Department of Public Safety.           The landslide was reported Monday around 9 p.m. local time on the Zimovia Highway near Wrangell, and walloped three homes in its path, department officials said. Alaska’s Department of Transportation said the path grew to an estimated 450 feet wide and had a significant debris field.           A girl was found dead during initial search and rescue efforts Monday night, and the remains of two adults were located by a drone operator Tuesday and recovered, according to the department.           A woman was rescued from the slide area Tuesday morning, but officials believe two juveniles and an adult are still unaccounted for.           State troopers are leading ongoing search and rescue efforts, although the ground search was temporarily paused on Tuesday until the slide could be assessed for safety issues, the department said Tuesday morning. A geologist has since cleared some ground portions to resume search efforts, and more geologists are traveling to Wrangell to conduct further testing.           About 20 to 30 people have been displaced by the destructive landslide, Wrangell Borough Manager Mason Villarma said Tuesday.           The area has been wet in recent days — typical for this time of year there — but it was particularly rainy on Sunday and Monday, with more than 3 inches of rain falling around Wrangell in the 24 hours leading up to the landslide, Andy Park, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Juneau, told CNN.           Park said winds of 61 to 87 mph Monday evening may have been a factor in the landslides as well.           The region of southeast Alaska is already at risk for debris flows, according to Barrett Salisbury, a geologist with the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. Heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or saturated soil only increase that risk, he said in a news conference.           Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has issued a disaster declaration in Wrangel due to the landslide’s impacts, his office posted on social media.           Alaska’s Department of Public Safety has urged people not to enter the slide area as it was active throughout Tuesday night and additional landslides are possible.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Man who lived frugally leaves unexpected gift of $3.8 million to small New Hampshire town after death,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/us/hinsdale-new-hampshire-town-donation/index.html,"       A man who lived frugally all his life left an unexpected gift of $3.8 million after his death to his small New Hampshire town with less than 4,000 residents.           Geoffrey Holt, who died on June 6, left his fortune to the town of Hinsdale, which borders Massachusetts, Edwin “Smokey” Smith, Holt’s best friend, told CNN in a phone call Tuesday. He moved to New Hampshire in 1968 and lived on his social security checks for the last 15 years of his life, Smith said.           Holt lived in a trailer park in the town, and the kitchen chairs in his mobile home were made of plywood, Smith said.           “Geoffrey lived very simply. And he didn’t require a lot,” said Smith.           The nearly $4 million gift came from a trust fund Holt established in 2001, primarily made in mutual funds accounts, according to Smith.           “There was no probate. He had everything set up in trust,” Smith said. “Geoffrey was the first trustee … and then on his passing, I became a successor trustee.”           “When he was younger, much to his dismay, his parents sent him to boarding school,” Smith said, noting Holt wanted to go to public school.           Holt’s fortune was left to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, according to Kathryn Lynch, the town’s administrator. Members of the town, including schools and local organizations, can apply annually for grants for up to $150,000 per year, Lynch said.           The town is considering various avenues to use the funds from the newfound gift, Lynch said, including possibly buying an electronic voting machine and fixing the town hall clock, which doesn’t work properly.           “First is to get electronic ballots in Mr. Holts honor as he was an avid voter and our Supervisors of the Checklist count ballots by hand at elections,” Lynch said.           In a statement to CNN, Kristen Oliveri, a spokesperson with the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, said Holt’s “generosity has the potential to be transformational for a small community like Hinsdale.”           Oliveri said the funds will be used to support “projects, programs and organizations that provide health, educational, recreational or cultural benefits to the residents of Hinsdale.”           “The Charitable Foundation is honored to help put such generosity into action, and we look forward to helping distribute these funds in the years to come,” she said.           While Smith emphasized his friend would be happy to know his gift is being appreciated and recognized, he noted Holt would also be stressed at the thought of being in the “limelight.”           “He didn’t like to be in the front of the crowd,” Smith said. “He liked to be in the back. And not just as a follower. He did his own thing…”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
us,"Shooter wounds 4 at Walmart near Dayton, Ohio, before dying of self-inflicted gunshot wound, police say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/us/walmart-ohio-beavercreek-shooting/index.html,"       Four people were wounded after a shooter opened fire at a Walmart near Dayton, Ohio, before taking his own life Monday night, authorities said.           The suspect was identified as 20-year-old Benjamin Charles Jones, who lived in Dayton, said Capt. Chad Lindsey, acting Beavercreek Police Department chief, during a Tuesday news conference.           Police said Jones entered the store in Beavercreek, about 10 miles east of Dayton, around 8:35 p.m. and shot four people before turning the gun on himself.           Witnesses saw Jones enter the Walmart holding a rifle that police identified as a Hi-Point .45 caliber carbine long gun, which is a semi-automatic rifle, Lindsey said. He then walked through different parts of the store, appearing to shoot indiscriminately at patrons, he added.           “No shots were fired by any responding police officers,” the department said in a social media post.     Search for Colorado shooter underway after 3 killed, 1 wounded in dispute over property lines, sheriff says         The victims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment, Capt. Scott Molnar said in a news briefing on Monday.           One man and three women were injured. Three are in stable condition and one remains in critical condition, Lindsey said on Tuesday. Police didn’t provide specifics about their conditions.           The gunshot injuries sustained by the victims appeared to be “largely random,” Lindsey said, and the wounds were “throughout all different parts of the body.”           Police did not release any additional information about the victims but noted details about their backgrounds or races are considered part of the ongoing investigation into a possible motive behind the attack.           It’s at least the second deadly shooting at the same store where, nearly 10 years ago, police shot and killed a Black man who was holding an air rifle he had found on a store shelf and was not in its packaging. The killing sparked outrage and calls for reform.         Police responded to the scene within three minutes of receiving the first 911 call about the shooter, Lindsey said on Tuesday when he broke down the agency’s response to the shooting and shared footage from a responding officer’s body-worn camera.           Roughly seven minutes after the first call, officers found the shooter on the ground toward the store’s front entrance with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he said. Police secured and cleared the building less than an hour after arriving on scene, according to Lindsey.           Monday night’s violence adds to a long list of shootings that have turned commonplace events and settings across the country – retail stores, schools, bowling alleys and birthday parties – into crime scenes.           There have been at least 609 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter.         A gunman nearly a year ago killed six people at another Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Since then, thousands of people have been killed by gun violence in the US, according to the archive. Many simply found themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time.           Walmart will offer emergency support to affected associates and set up an offsite resource center offering counseling, the company said in a statement.           “With details of Monday night’s shooting at our Beavercreek store still coming to light, we’re focused on providing our associates with the attention and support needed to cope with this tragedy,” the statement read.           No decision has been made on when the store will reopen, the company said.           The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations, were all investigating the shooting Monday night.           Students at nearby Wright State University shop at the store, they told CNN affiliate WKEF.           “It’s crazy thinking that we’re literally less than five minutes away where we live. They could have went to a campus and not a Walmart, and it could have been us,” Wright State University student Kailie Conley told WKEF.     This story has been updated with additional information.

us,"Suspect in Colorado mass shooting that left 3 dead has been arrested, sheriff’s office says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/us/custer-county-colorado-shooting/index.html,"       The man suspected of killing three people and seriously wounding a fourth in rural Colorado has been arrested, the Custer County Sheriff’s Office said.           Hanme K. Clark, 45, is accused of shooting four people Monday in a wooded part of Custer County after an apparent dispute over property lines, according to the sheriff.           Clark was arrested by the New Mexico State Police, the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post Tuesday evening.           Earlier Tuesday, the sheriff had told reporters an arrest warrant was obtained for Clark on three counts of first-degree murder.           He was captured shortly before 3 p.m. near Albuquerque, Custer County Sheriff Lloyd “Rich” Smith said during a news conference after the announcement of the arrest. Clark was taken into custody without incident and “nobody was injured,” the sheriff said.           “That’s the best resolution for us,” Smith said. “Our teams worked around the clock to catch him.”           The mass shooting happened around 1 p.m. Monday when the killer opened fire on five people in a wooded area, Smith said at a news conference Monday night.           Two men and a woman were killed, he said. Another woman suffered gunshots to the chest and is expected to survive, while a fifth person managed to escape, Smith said.           “The suspect and at least one of the victims have been in previous civil disputes about property lines and easements,” Smith said, without providing further details.           The three victims were identified Tuesday by the Custer County coroner as Rob Geers, 63, and his wife, Beth Wade Geers, 73, and James Daulton, 58, the sheriff said.           Daulton’s wife, Patty Daulton, was wounded and was being treated for her injuries at a trauma center, authorities said. In Tuesday’s news conference, the sheriff said Daulton was “improving.”           The Daultons and the Geers were property owners and their property bordered the suspect’s, the sheriff said.           “We got the suspect in custody and that was the priority and now we have a pretty lengthy investigation to go to take this case to prosecution,” Smith said. “I hope that this brings relief to the neighborhood and to the community and more importantly, closure to the families of the victims and their friends.”           The deadly attack marks at least the 609th mass shooting in the US so far this year with four or more people shot, excluding the perpetrator, data from the Gun Violence Archive shows.     What’s going on with all the wrong-place wrong-time shootings?         The shooting happened in a remote part of Custer County, near the border with Fremont County, Smith said.           When authorities arrived, “We didn’t know where the shooter was. The shooting happened in a wooded area, and so we entered kind of at a high risk,” the sheriff said.           “We did find a survivor, and we were able to bring her out of the hot zone and get her to the ambulance,” Smith said. The survivor had suffered gunshot wounds and was flown to a Level 1 trauma center in Colorado Springs.           As a Fremont County SWAT team, a drone and other law enforcement personnel hunted for the suspect, a local shelter-in-place order was issued at 1:43 p.m., Smith said. The order was lifted Monday night.           “We have a very good lead on almost exactly where the suspect and the vehicle are,” Smith said Monday night, “and we’re working with another law enforcement agency to take him into custody.”     This story has been updated with additional information.

us,"‘Every move I make, I second guess’: These Muslim and Arab Americans say the surge in hate has made them more vigilant",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/us/hate-crimes-surge-us-muslims-arabs-react-reaj/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Read how Jews in America say they have been impacted.         Nicole was walking through an affluent part of Alexandria, Virginia, with a friend last month, when a man approached her and began screaming.           He railed about the hijab she wore, saying she looked Muslim, and made comments about Hamas raping Israeli women, she said. Her friend corroborated the account.           It was just days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war and the encounter left Nicole feeling rattled, worried and frightened. So much so, that she asked CNN to use only her first name, out of fear for her family’s safety.           “I haven’t stopped wearing hijab. I didn’t after 9/11 either,” she told CNN. “If I have one more person scream at me in public and certainly if someone were to threaten me, I think all bets are off.”           Nicole, who is in her 40s, said she’s been wearing a hijab for more than half of her life. And while she’s grown used to stares and occasional comments about her headscarf, Nicole said she fears the growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the US could escalate into violence.           The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the US is experiencing an “unprecedented” increase in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the weeks since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.           A week after the Hamas attack, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy was stabbed to death outside of Chicago. His family’s landlord was charged in what police are calling a hate crime. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges including murder.           A Muslim postal worker was attacked while wearing a hijab, and many Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian Americans leaders have told CNN they are experiencing post-9/11 levels Islamophobia – or worse. They’ve called on the Biden administration to do more to combat anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias.           CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Nearly 800 people responded from across the country.           Some, citing safety concerns, are changing how they go about their daily lives. Others have become defiant and more vocal about their identity. These are their stories.           Although Abdallah Jwayyed has been a registered gun owner for years, he said his gun remained locked away in a safe – until now.           As reports of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab attacks rose across the country, Jwayyed said he began carrying his concealed weapon when he goes out around his Cleveland, Ohio, home and when he’s shopping with his wife.           He’s also removed the Palestinian flag hanging from his rear-view mirror and peeled the Allah bumper stickers off his car. He doesn’t want anyone to slash his tires or break his windows, he said.         CAIR received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month after Hamas attacked Israel. This marks a 216% percent increase in requests for help and reports of bias compared to the previous year, CAIR said.           The Palestinian American is proud of his heritage, but he said he is doing everything he can to protect his wife and three children.           “We’re tired of having to hide the fact that we’re Muslim or to hide the fact that we’re Palestinian,” Jwayyed said. “We have to hide who we are to live safely in America.”           As a father, Jwayyed said he was crushed by the news that a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death near Chicago. Officials have said Wadea Al-Fayoume was killed because he was Muslim.           “I have a 7-year-old son, I have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old daughter. Of course, that affects me,” Jwayyed said. “As a parent, it scares me.”           Since the war, the 34-year-old said he has stopped taking his children on weekly excursions to the movies and local parks. Now, Jwayyed said they only go to school or to a relative’s house.           “Baba, why don’t you take us out this week?” he said his children have asked.           “I don’t want to tell them, ‘I fear for your life. It’s dangerous outside,’” Jwayyed said. “They don’t need to know that.”           Jwayyed lives in the Little Arabia neighborhood, which is full of Middle Eastern stores and restaurants, but he said he is no longer shopping at stores that carry Israeli products, like his wife’s favorite brand of chips. Instead, he said, the family agreed to stop buying the snacks after the war started and now they only shop at an Arab grocery store.           “Anything Israeli made, I will boycott it,” Jwayyed said. “And not just any Israeli company, any company that’s sympathizing with Israel will not get my money.”           Since October 7, Mona said daily activities she used to enjoy have become anxiety-inducing. She’s now limiting her trips to the grocery store, taking her kids to the park and driving alone out of fear of being targeted for being a Muslim woman who wears a hijab and dresses modestly.           “As a visibly Muslim woman, I’m fearful that I will be targeted,” she said. “Every move I make, I second guess it.”           Mona, who is in her 30s, asked CNN not to use her last name out of fear for her family’s safety.           She said she traces her fear and anxiety to the outset of the war and the spike in hate crimes against the Muslim community. As a health care worker near Houston, Texas, she said she was especially heartbroken over the October 28 fatal stabbing of Houston-area Muslim pediatrician Dr. Talat Jehan Khan.           While local police have said they have not yet found evidence linking Khan’s death to a hate crime, Mona said the attack on Khan has left her shaken.           “That also makes you think, ‘What, am I going to be next?’”           She is avoiding social gatherings and meeting in public with her friends who are also visibly Muslim, so they are “not a target collectively.” She’s also not publicly showing empathy and solidarity toward Gaza, out of concern, she said, of being targeted or attacked.           Instead, Mona now wears a necklace in the shape of the Palestinian territory underneath her clothing – close to her heart – in quiet solidarity.           Yasmeen Abou-Sayed said she refuses to change the way she lives.           Instead, since the war began, she said she’s become more civically engaged and has been calling out anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment when she sees it.           When her children’s school district posted a statement condemning antisemitism but neglected to mention Islamophobia, the 41-year-old from suburban Washington, D.C., and other parents reached out to the superintendent and the board of education.           She asked us not to name the school district out of fear for the safety of her children, who have a different last name.           “Being an afterthought … we had to, as parents, mobilize, reach out to the superintendent and the board of education and point out that their statement completely excluded the experiences of our Muslim and Arab students in the schools,” Abou-Sayed said.           The next day, the superintendent posted an updated statement acknowledging that Islamophobia should also have been included, according to two statements reviewed by CNN.           “I will always advocate for myself. I will always advocate for my kids,” Abou-Sayed said. “But it’s just kind of tiring that you always have to take those extra steps to be seen.”           While anti-Muslim sentiment is nothing new in America, Abou-Sayed said her perspective has shifted since the war began. She said she will now talk to her sons about how some people might view them as they become Muslim men.           “I never thought about preparing them a little bit more for how the world is going to treat them until now,” she said.           “I do wear hijab,” she said. “I won’t change the way I live my life because the second you compromise your own values and principles, what are you living for?”           Abou-Sayed said she remains proud and unwavering about her identity.           “I will continue in my day-to-day activities, taking my kids to soccer and their clubs at school and doing the things that we do,” Abou-Sayed said. “We’re not going to change our lives because of this, but I will be more vigilant.”     This story has been updated with additional details.   © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,California’s DOJ investigating after an officer opened fire and killed a pedestrian in middle of a freeway,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/us/california-highway-patrol-shooting-interstate-105/index.html,"       The California Department of Justice is investigating after a state officer opened fire and killed a pedestrian in the middle of a Southern California freeway, the department announced Monday.           A video posted online Sunday appears to show a California Highway Patrol officer shooting a person multiple times after a struggle in the middle of Interstate 105 in south Los Angeles County.           A California Highway Patrol unit responded to a call around 3:15 p.m. Sunday about a person walking within traffic lanes along the freeway’s westbound lanes, the agency said in a news release. When the unit made contact with the pedestrian, “a struggle ensued and an officer involved shooting occurred,” according to the news release.           The officer was “in fear for his safety” after the individual used a taser against the officer, according to a separate statement from the California Highway Patrol.           “During the struggle, the pedestrian was able to access a taser he had in his possession, activated the weapon, and used the taser against the officer.” the statement read. “Following the pedestrian’s use of the weapon against the officer, and in fear for his safety, the officer fired his service weapon, striking the pedestrian.”           The initial highway patrol statement made no mention of a taser. CNN has reached out to the agency for the updated statement.           It’s unclear what led to the altercation. The department declined to provide any additional details, including the name of the pedestrian, and deferred all inquiries to the California Department of Justice.           The bystander video of the incident starts with the officer on top of the pedestrian in the middle of the freeway. The officer then draws their gun and a round quickly appears to strike the pavement next to the person. The footage shows the officer getting up and backing away while firing several more rounds at the person, who was still on the ground.           Under California law, state prosecutors are required to investigate all police shootings that involve the death of an unarmed civilian.           CNN has reached out to the California Department of Justice to confirm if it is aware of the bystander video, and whether the department considers the alleged use of a taser against an officer a justified use of deadly force.           The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirmed to CNN the individual died, but the office was not able to identify the victim as the case is still pending next of kin notification.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

These Jewish Americans say it’s changing the way they live,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/us/hate-crimes-surge-us-jews-react-reaj/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Read how Arabs and Muslims in America say they have been impacted.         Melissa Franklin has always decorated her home for Hanukkah – proudly hanging a Star of David on her porch and placing her family’s menorah in the front window.           This year, however, will be different.           “I just can’t see us doing it because I don’t want retaliation,” Franklin said. “I don’t want vandalism on my home.”           In the weeks since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, hate crimes and antisemitism have spiked across the United States.           Jewish synagogues  and community centers have increased security amid threats of violence, protests have erupted on college campuses, and a 69-year-old Jewish man, Paul Kessler, died in Southern California following a confrontation at dueling protests over the war. A pro-Palestinian protester has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and battery causing serious bodily injury in Kessler’s death. He has pleaded not guilty. A statement from his attorney called his actions that day “peaceful.”           Franklin said the surge in antisemitism has made her feel uncomfortable making any public display of her Jewish identity, or her support for Israel.           Leaders from the Jewish Federations of North America acknowledged there is widespread fear among Jewish families. Sarah Eisenman, chief community and Jewish life officer for the organization, said she empathizes with Jewish Americans who are changing their normal routines or hiding markers of their Jewish heritage to avoid being targeted.           “I do think they are rightfully fearful,” Eisenman said. “I think it’s a scary environment right now and we should all be outraged at what we are seeing.”           CNN recently asked Arabs, Muslims and Jews in America how they are facing the new reality of increased hate-motivated attacks against their communities. Nearly 800 people responded from across the country.          Some Jewish Americans told CNN they are now hiding their kippahs, refusing to wear their Star of David necklaces and changing long-held traditions for religious holidays.           Some practicing Jews have said they are even afraid to visit one of the most sacred places in their faith — the synagogue — out of fear of being killed, attacked or harassed because of their religion. These are their stories.           Michael Edelman said his mother has always warned him not to expose his kippah — a head covering traditionally worn by Jewish men — on public transportation in New York City.           “My mother would always tell me ‘Please wear a hat when you go on the trains,’” Edelman said, adding she feared he could be attacked or targeted for his religious beliefs.           For years, Edelman, 25, said he ignored his mother’s concerns.           But as the Israel-Hamas war continues to drive a surge in antisemitism in the US, he said he’s taking her advice more seriously.           Now, every time he leaves the house, Edelman said he puts a baseball cap over his kippah.         The Anti-Defamation League said it recorded 312 antisemitic incidents across the United States over the first 17 days after the Hamas Oct. 7 attack on Israel. These incidents include harassment, vandalism and assault, the ADL said.           “People say you should be proud and not be afraid, but overall, I think it’s smarter to wear a hat (over my kippah),” he said.           Edelman said the news reports of antisemitic attacks and anti-Israel protests have also made him more mindful of his surroundings in public. He has stopped wearing headphones while walking, so he can hear if someone is approaching.           Earlier this year, Edelman graduated from Yeshiva University, but he said seeing the haunting images on TV of the Israel-Hamas war — especially images of victims and the widespread destruction — has made him so anxious he has struggled to focus on applying for jobs.           “It’s been hard to focus I’m not going to lie,” Edelman said. “I check the news 24/7.”           In recent weeks, he said he’s avoided parts of New York where rallies are taking place, in case violence erupts. He also avoids walking near the Columbia University campus where tensions have simmered after a student was assaulted while hanging up posters in support of Israel. New York police charged another student with assault and harassment as a hate crime.           One thing the war will not stop him from doing, Edelman said, is going to his synagogue to pray — it gives him comfort during a difficult time.           “We pray for peace constantly,” Edelman said. “We pray three times a day.”           Elliot Malin has proudly worn a Star of David necklace his entire life.           But after protests erupted in his Reno, Nevada, community and he learned of attacks against Jews across the country, he decided to take it off.           In October, Malin said demonstrators at a pro-Palestine rally yelled antisemitic obscenities at him.           Malin, a 31-year-old political consultant, said he attended the rally to make sure Jewish community members were not putting themselves at risk and chose not to engage with the demonstrators. But the threats have had a chilling effect.           “I know that I am a very visible member of the community, but my wife is not as visible. My parents are not as visible, and I am afraid for them,” he said.           Now, Malin and his family are considering removing their Mezuzah – a sacred scroll that blesses a home – from their doorpost. Malin said someone drew a swastika on the light post in front of his house in 2016. He now worries it could happen again.           “What we are seeing is a lot more danger and a lot more fear,” he said. “We are just trying to protect ourselves as much as we can.”           But his past experiences have made him more worried about his family’s safety.           Malin said he has been to a synagogue only once since the war started and has no immediate plans to return. Although there were armed security guards present, he said he still felt uneasy.           “We can’t pray without armed police presence,” he said. “We can’t go to our synagogues without somebody being there with guns. In what world would this be acceptable for any other religion? Some of our Muslim neighbors have to deal with the same thing and it’s not fair to them either.”           Although Melissa Franklin has chosen not to decorate her house for Hanukkah, the Phoenix-area mother said her biggest concern lately has been the safety of her four college-aged children.           Franklin, 50, said she has asked them to hide anything that represents their Jewish identity including their Star of David necklaces and her son’s Hebrew tattoo.           “It’s like, ‘Don’t go out of your way to be publicly Jewish,’ and that’s really sad,” Franklin said.           She’s particularly worried about her children being caught in the middle of the dueling protests that have erupted on college campuses across the country.           The climate on the campuses, she said, is “terrifying and too much to bear.”           Franklin hasn’t felt safe going to Jewish community events or her synagogue, despite security being in place.           “Honestly, I just don’t feel comfortable,” she said. “I don’t want to orphan my kids because I was naïve enough to go and think that nothing would happen to me.”           As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, Franklin said she never imagined a mass attack on Israel in her lifetime.           The world vowed “never again,” and Franklin said she always hoped that the mass killing and attacks on Jews would not be repeated.           “You feel this insulation from the terror the past generation has gone through – but it’s just a false sense of security,” she said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

The push to highlight easing prices comes as the Biden administration has struggled to move the needle with voters who say their pocketbooks are in pain — despite some improved economic indicators.

A Hamas leader said today the militant group is “close to reaching a truce agreement” with Israel, supporting similar assertions from the White House. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that negotiators are “getting close to the end” on the release of hostages held by Hamas — but he declined to elaborate on the details of a potential deal. An estimated 239 hostages are being held in Gaza, abducted during Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel that killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli military. Also, in a rare glimmer of hope for Gaza, 28 premature babies arrived in Egypt today as Palestinian authorities ramp up efforts to transport injured patients through the Rafah crossing for life-saving treatment.           OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is facing a potential wave of employee resignations following the surprise ouster of CEO Sam Altman. More than 500 employees signed a letter threatening to quit after they accused the OpenAI board of mishandling Altman’s firing and “negotiating in bad faith” with the company’s executive leadership. In the scathing letter, the employees warned that they would “imminently” follow Altman to Microsoft unless the board resigns and reinstates him and Greg Brockman, the former president of OpenAI who was also removed by the board on Friday. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after announcing that Altman will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation division.           As many Americans look forward to embracing loved ones this Thanksgiving holiday, health experts are encouraging safe gathering habits amid a mix of seasonal viruses in circulation. The latest CDC data shows cases of flu, Covid-19 and RSV are picking up in most parts of the country, meaning many common public surfaces and heavily populated areas may potentially be contaminated. However, there are a number of familiar precautions you can take to keep from catching an illness from fellow travelers or out-of-town visitors such as handwashing, opening windows when possible and masking in areas with limited ventilation. Vaccines are also available at hospitals and major retail pharmacy chains, experts stress. Plus, each US household is now eligible to order an additional four at-home Covid-19 tests — for free.           A court will decide how much former President Trump can directly criticize Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing his federal 2020 election subversion case. On Monday, a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, heard oral arguments for over 2 hours about the gag order issued against Trump by the judge. The order restricts Trump’s ability to publicly target court personnel, witnesses or Jack Smith and his staff. Overall, the judges were skeptical of Trump’s broad arguments that the gag order violated his free speech rights, but may loosen some of the restrictions against him. The appeals court has temporarily frozen the order, a move that last week allowed Trump to continue his attacks on the special counsel and his family.           Police say four people were injured after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart near Dayton, Ohio, before taking his own life Monday night. Authorities say the suspect entered the store around 8:35 p.m. ET and shot four people before turning the gun on himself. The victims were taken to hospitals for treatment, though their current conditions remain unclear. Monday night’s violence marks at least the second deadly shooting at the store. It is also among at least 609 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Separately, a search is underway for a Colorado shooter after three people were killed Monday in a dispute over property lines. The incident in the rural southern Colorado area remains under investigation.

Hundreds of families are agonizing over the fate of their loved ones as sources say a possible deal to secure the release of some hostages held by Hamas may be in sight. Negotiations have been in progress for weeks between the US, Israel and the militant group, mediated by Gulf state Qatar, but an agreement has yet to be struck. Still, negotiators from various countries, including senior Biden administration officials, are expressing rare optimism about the progress, saying gaps in some of the major sticking points have begun to close. At Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza, the Israeli military alleges the facility is being used by Hamas as a shield for its operations but Hamas and hospital officials have denied Israel’s claims.           Former President Donald Trump on Sunday visited Texas near the US-Mexico border as he escalates his anti-immigrant rhetoric and campaigns on hard-line immigration policy proposals. During the visit, Trump received the endorsement of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who continues to spar with the Biden administration over its efforts to curtail illegal immigration. Also on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris aimed to confront Biden’s lackluster polling and age concerns. “We’re going to have to earn our reelect, there’s no doubt about it,” Harris told CNN. Separately on the campaign trail, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the presidency is “not a job for somebody that is pushing 80” as he sought to contrast his youth relative to former President Donald Trump, 77, and President Joe Biden, who turns 81 today.           Tens of millions of people across the US are at risk of severe storms this week that could impact Thanksgiving travel. One notable storm system is headed into the South after blowing through the Rockies over the weekend, leaving heavy mountain snowfall piled nearly a foot high in parts of Utah, Nevada and Colorado. The day with the most weather-related headaches for travelers is likely to be Tuesday, with a low-pressure system bringing rain and thunderstorms to the majority of the eastern half of the country. Several areas expecting rain include major airport cities — New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta. All could see delays and frustrations due to the wet forecast.

Microsoft has hired former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the tech giant announced today. This comes just three days after OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, fired its founder in a chaotic boardroom coup. While the details of Altman’s firing remain murky, OpenAI in an announcement claimed Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board and that it had hindered the board’s ability to carry out its responsibilities. Analysts also say a key factor in Altman’s ouster was tension between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously.

us,I-10 reopens in Los Angeles after massive fire as police seek individual last seen near where the flames erupted,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/19/us/arson-i-10-freeway-fire/index.html,"       A portion of Interstate 10 in downtown Los Angeles has reopened ahead of schedule after it was closed to traffic following a massive fire earlier this month, as police seek to identify a man seen near where the flames started.           The shuttered portion of freeway, which typically sees more than 300,000 daily drivers, is open for vehicle traffic, the California Highway Patrol said.           “Traffic is now flowing on all five lanes in each direction on the I-10, ahead of tomorrow morning’s commute and before the Thanksgiving holiday,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said in a social media post Sunday night.           Officials previously said the roadway would open Tuesday.           The vital transportation corridor was closed as crews worked to clear the site and assess and repair damage following the November 11 fire, which started at a nearby storage yard and spread under an elevated portion of the freeway.           Officials believe the fire was set intentionally.           CalFire on Saturday released two images and a description of a man seen on video at the Alameda Street location when the fire began.           The person was last seen wearing a black hoodie, blue shorts, a black backpack and was carrying a green scarf, a news release from CalFire said.           The individual “also had a knee brace on his right knee,” according to CalFire. “The subject appeared to have visible burn injuries on his left leg. The subject then leaves the immediate area and is unable to be located.”           Newsom said in a Sunday morning news conference that officials received potentially helpful information after the images of the person of interest were released on Saturday.           Last week, Newsom said a preliminary investigation determined the fire was started with “malice intent” and was “set intentionally.” The state fire marshal, Daniel Berlant, said last week that it was unclear how many people were involved.           The blaze was first reported at a 200-by-200-foot storage yard and then quickly spread underneath the interstate, fire officials said.

us,Families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas give heart-wrenching details at the packed ‘March for Israel’ in DC,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/14/us/march-for-israel-washington-security/index.html,"       Alana Zeitchik stood alone before a massive crowd that filled the National Mall. But she represented countless families in the US and around the world ripped apart by Hamas’ mass kidnappings and slaughter in Israel.           “I wake up each morning to remember this truth: My family is being held hostage by terrorists,” Zeitchik told the crowd from a stage Tuesday at the “March for Israel” rally in Washington, DC.     Israel-Hamas war rages as outcry grows over Gaza crisis         The march is believed to be the largest pro-Israel gathering in the US since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, which began last month when Hamas inflicted widespread carnage in Israel, slaughtering children, torching homes, kidnapping soldiers and civilians alike.           Six of Zeitchik’s family members have been held hostage by Hamas since October 7, when the militant group snatched them from their kibbutz.           “While the kibbutz was ravaged by Hamas, they hid in their bomb shelter for hours – until it filled with smoke and they could not hide any longer,” she said.           Zeitchik joined thousands of demonstrators in supporting Israel, denouncing antisemitism and demanding Hamas release its hostages. And like several other speakers, she also expressed sympathy for innocent Palestinians suffering during the Israel-Hamas conflict.     Hamas launched a coordinated attack on Israel from Gaza on October 7, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping about 200 hostages. The massacre in Israel coincided with rising reports of antisemitism in the US and other countries.           Israel responded by launching airstrikes on Gaza targeting Hamas, which often uses civilians as human shields. Israel’s attacks have destroyed homes and schools and severed access to life-saving care as the death toll rises among Palestinian civilians in the densely populated Gaza Strip.     How to help humanitarian efforts in Israel and Gaza         More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in Hamas-controlled territory. A UNICEF spokesperson says figures from the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza have historically matched those from the international children’s humanitarian agency.           But the world doesn’t need to take sides and support only Israeli civilians or Palestinian civilians, Zeitchik said.           “For too many, it feels like to care about one family – to love one child – is to diminish the suffering of another,” Zeitchik said.           “But the simple human truth is that you don’t have to choose. You can abhor the suffering of Palestinian families and the suffering of Israeli families like mine. You can call for peace and the immediate return of the innocent men, women and children who were violently taken from us. It doesn’t need to be political to share in my grief or in the anguish that the Israeli people are feeling.”           Actress and Jewish activist Debra Messing also emphasized her support for Israel, Jews around the world, and innocent Palestinians and Gazans.           “Those who hate us deny our humanity and our right to exist,” Messing told the crowd. “No matter. We know who we are. We know that even in – especially in – darkness, we stand united, proud, resolute.”     Israel shows alleged Hamas ‘armory’ under children’s hospital in Gaza. Local health officials dismiss the claims         “We will worry for our global Jewish family and also hurt for the innocent Palestinians used as human shields by Hamas,” Messing said. “We will work to eviscerate Hamas and also pray for a free and flourishing Gaza.”           She also called for Hamas’ release of hostages.           “We will remember and work for the release of the 240 hostages as well as for the safety of the 2.2 million Gazans also held hostage by Hamas,” Messing said. “We will pray for the success of the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) in a war Israel did not start and did not want, but a war Israel will win – because we must.”           Messages of unity at the rally spanned continents and political parties.           Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed the crowd through a live video feed. Despite the thousands of miles separating them, Herzog told demonstrators they are united “to march for the babies, the boys and girls, women and men viciously held hostage by Hamas; to march for the right of every Jew to live proudly and safely in America, in Israel and all around the world.”           Herzog also thanked President Joe Biden, his administration and “so many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle” for their support of Israel.           Congressional leaders from both parties found common ground at the rally. Democrats Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries proclaimed steadfast support for Israel, as did new Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Sen. Joni Ernst.           “We are here today as Republicans and Democrats to assure you that we will not shrink back and shudder in fear,” Ernst told the crowd.           IDF soldier Omer Neutra had a comfortable childhood growing up in Long Island, New York. The “optimistic and people-loving person” was always smiling and made friends wherever he went, his mother Orna Neutra said at the rally Tuesday.           “After graduating high school, he decided to take a gap year in Israel to connect with his roots,” his mother said. “As a descendant of Holocaust survivors on both sides, he understood the importance of a strong Israel. So being the person that he is, he made the decision to join his new friends and serve in the IDF and protect the country.”           But her son’s mission led to his capture by Hamas.          “Omer – born one month after 9/11 – celebrated his 22nd birthday only a few weeks ago, captive by Hamas,” his mother said.           She gave her son a poignant message from across the world:           “From a place of deep pain, we hold strong for you, Omer,” Orna Neutra said.           Omer Neutra’s high school friend Sara Blau also attended the rally, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with his photo.     UN mourns the deaths of more than 100 aid workers in Gaza, the highest number killed in any conflict in its history         “We were very good friends,” said Blau, now a student at the University of Maryland. “Everyone loves him. He’s funny. He’s kind, charismatic. He’s a natural-born leader and everyone’s being impacted really heavily by this.”           Blau said she wanted to join the march “to show my support for Israel. I’m a proud Zionist, a proud Jew and I wanted to be here to support my community.”           American support for Israel is critical, said Eric D. Fingerhut, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America – one of the organizers of the March for Israel.           “On October 7th, merciless Hamas terrorists launched the deadliest attack on Israel in its 75-year history, brutally murdering the most Jewish people in a single day since the Holocaust,” Fingerhut said in a statement.           The Department of Homeland Security deemed the march a “Level 1” security event – the highest possible level – after considering national importance, potential threats and the resources needed to ensure public safety, law enforcement sources said.     Antisemitic vandalism rattles Jewish communities amid growing tension in the US         Such intense security was unprecedented for a march or protest in Washington, said Donell Harvin, a former DC chief of homeland security and intelligence.           “There has never been a First Amendment event in DC that has been designated as a … Level 1 event,” Harvin told CNN. “Those designations are reserved for high-profile events such as the Super Bowl, and World Series.”           The Level 1 designation allows the federal government to fill possible gaps in local security, including explosive detection, cyber risk assessments and venue screening. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said the National Guard was deployed to assist local police.           “The U.S. remains in a heightened threat environment and recent events reinforce that,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN in an email.    ‘Anxiety and fear are high:’ US Palestinians, Muslims fear a return to post-9/11 Islamophobia         “As the Israel-Hamas conflict continues, we have seen an increase in reports of threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities and institutions,” the DHS official said. “Lone offenders, motivated by a range of violent ideologies, pose the most likely threat. We urge the public to stay vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activity to their local law enforcement.”           Tuesday’s march followed other protests have denounced Israel’s airstrikes in Gaza. Some Jewish activists are among those calling for a ceasefire to prevent more civilian deaths.           Just blocks away from the site of Tuesday’s march, throngs of demonstrators recently gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington to support Palestinian civilians and demand a ceasefire.           While many have called for a humanitarian pause in fighting so Palestinian civilians can be moved to safety, Israel has firmly rejected the idea as long as Hamas keeps holding hostages. But Israel has agreed to four-hour, daily pauses in military operations in Gaza to allow for evacuations.

us,"‘All I wanted to do was live’: After years of debate, a suicide safety net for the Golden Gate Bridge is nearing completion. Survivors say it’ll give many a 2nd chance at life",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/19/us/golden-gate-bridge-suicide-safety-net/index.html,"       On September 25, 2000, Kevin Hines climbed over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge.            White fog hung below the gray skies that day. He recalled looking down at the rough, green waters below moments before he did the unthinkable: He jumped.           “My hands left the rail and I had an instantaneous regret for my actions,” Hines told CNN.            Hines fell 220 feet at a speed of 75 miles per hour – “equivalent to a pedestrian being struck by a car that is traveling that fast,” according to the Bridge Rail Foundation, a nonprofit working to prevent suicides on the bridge.           During the 4-second fall, Hines said the feeling of depression left his mind, and was replaced by a survival urge he described as almost instinctual.           “And at that time, all I wanted to do was live.”           After he was rescued from the water, Hines needed three vertebrae replaced with a titanium metal plate and pins, ultimately undergoing four and half weeks of recovery. And in the years since, Hines has been traveling the world to share his rare testimony.           “I have met thousands of people who have survived mild, moderate to extreme suicide attempts who have all said they each had the same instant regret,” Hines said. “They recognized their thoughts didn’t have to become their actions.”           More than a confirmed 1,800 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge since it was built in 1937, according to the Bridge Rail Foundation. The very first incident happened that same year.           Hines is one of 39 people known to survive the deadly leap. “Nineteen have come forward to say they all had the exact same instant regret that I had,” Hines said.           After years of debate over installing a suicide deterrent on the iconic bridge, a net is now nearing completion.           In 2018, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District began building a net along the perimeter of the 1.7 mile long bridge.     Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.           The $217 million project consists of the installation of a stainless steel net, 20 feet below the sidewalk on both sides of the bridge, according to Golden Gate Bridge spokesperson Paolo Cosulich-Schwartz.            “The amount of net that we’re installing is the equivalent of seven football fields,” Cosulich-Schwartz told CNN.            It’s a project proponents hope will offer many people a second chance at life.           While Hines noted not all those who jump may feel regretful, he said he can’t help but empathize with those who did experience the same feeling but never got another chance to choose life.           “Recognizing that all the people that passed away might have wished they were still here… it’s a very troubling thing to think about,” he said.           Kevin Berthia attempted to jump off the Golden Gate on March 11, 2005. But after jumping, he ended up clinging to a railing for over an hour and a half.           “I swung myself around and smacked into the railing, and got on that 4-inch cord,” Berthia recalled.           And he held onto that cord as California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Briggs talked to him about reasons to choose life. It was in this 92-minute conversation that Berthia began to experience regret.     1. Do not leave the person alone.2.

While he credits Briggs for saving his life, Berthia also said he believes a safety net would have made a world of difference that day.           “I looked over that rail and all I saw was the water,” Berthia told CNN. “If I saw a deterrent, I would have probably been like, ‘OK, maybe this is not meant to be.’”            He desperately needed a sign that someone cared about him, Berthia added: “I needed something to say no.”            While the purpose of the net is “to reduce the number of injuries and deaths from jumping off the bridge,” bridge spokesperson Cosulich-Schwartz said it’s also meant to serve as that sign Berthia was looking for 18 years ago.            “The net is a symbol of hope and care for people who may be experiencing the worst day of their lives,” Cosulich-Schwartz said.           “It is a large, visible and permanent symbol that there are people in the community that care about you,” he continued. “And, if necessary, offer people a second chance.”           The net is currently 80% built, and is set to be completed in December, according to the bridge officials.           The construction of this deterrent won’t be a temporary solution in suicide prevention, according to researchers.            A 1978 study of Golden Gate Bridge suicide attempters found more than 90% of those who were stopped remained alive decades later, and didn’t go on to take their own lives.           Since the Golden Gate’s opening, suicide prevention groups and nonprofits like the Bridge Rail Foundation have continuously pushed for a deterrent of some sort on the bridge.           “Originally, we wanted to raise the rail,” Hines said, which would be similar to the 11-foot steel fence that encloses the George Washington Bridge in New York City.           The transportation district invited public comment on the potential project, and the opinions of the board and local residents were deeply divided.     Suicide survivor Kevin Hines shows Sanjay Gupta how every day is a  gift         “We got shut down with that because it was obstructing the view and people didn’t want to ruin the aesthetics of the bridge,” Hines told CNN. “And I always say, what are the aesthetics of a bridge compared to one human life?”           In 2014, the bridge’s board of directors unanimously approved the funding for the safety net construction.            “Engineers designed the Net to minimize impacts to Bridge views and appearance,” according to a Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District release, which noted the addition would still “slightly diminish the integrity of the the historic features.”           Berthia acknowledged many people enjoy the beauty and history of the Golden Gate. “And I get that, but we don’t listen to enough people that have lost loved ones off that bridge,” he said.           Thirty people or more die by suicide at the bridge each year on average, according to the release, with hundreds more stopped by law enforcement or other citizens.           “Ultimately, a physical barrier is needed to stop this tragedy,” the release said. “The selected design allows open, scenic vistas to remain intact, while preventing anyone from easily jumping to the water below.”           “I’m so grateful that not one more beautiful person with loved ones, and family and friends who care for them is ever again, gonna die by their hands off of the Golden Gate Bridge,” Hines said. “I thank God every day I get to be alive to see it.”     If you’re experiencing any thoughts of suicide or any form of self-harm, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.

us,Manhunt ends for suspect accused of killing 4 family members – including teen girl – in series of Memphis shootings,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/us/memphis-tennessee-shootings/index.html,"       A manhunt is over for the man suspected of fatally shooting four family members, including a 13-year-old girl, in Memphis, Tennessee, after police say he was found dead on Sunday from what appears to be a “self-inflicted gunshot wound.”           The suspect, Mavis Christian Jr., 52, was pronounced dead at the scene after his body was discovered inside a white Chevrolet Malibu, the Memphis Police Department said.           Investigators were searching for Christian after determining the shooting death of a woman on Saturday around 9:20 p.m. CT on Howard Drive was connected to other killings earlier in the day, police said.           “Preliminary information indicates this was a domestic violence incident, and the suspect is a known relative who fled each scene,” police said earlier in the day.           One of the shootings, on Fieldlark Drive, killed a woman and 13-year-old girl, and left a 15-year-old girl in critical condition, Memphis Police Department spokesman Christopher Williams said. The other shooting, nearly 13 miles away on Warrington Road, left another woman dead, police said.           Memphis Police said in a statement on social media on Sunday the four victims who died were family members.           “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their loved ones as our community grieves more lives taken by domestic violence,” the statement said.           Authorities have not identified the victims or provided information on how they were related to the suspect.           Memphis police said local, state and federal agencies were involved in the manhunt for Christian.           “Through the collaborative effort between law enforcement, the community, and the media, the suspect was located quickly without the additional loss of lives,” police said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,"Body of missing woman found in storage unit belonging to her estranged husband, police say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/19/us/missing-florida-woman-found-dead/index.html,"       Florida law enforcement officials are investigating a woman’s disappearance as a homicide after they say they found her body in a storage unit registered to her estranged husband, authorities said Sunday.           Shakeira Yvonne Rucker was reported missing after her family told the Winter Springs Police Department that they last saw her on November 11, the department said in a Facebook post on November 13.           Rucker’s family said she left her home for “an unknown destination,” possibly with her estranged husband, Cory Hill, at around 7:30 p.m. on November 11, police said.           “The family has not seen or heard from Shakeira since that day and believes that she may be in danger,” police said in the social media post.           The search for Rucker spanned four counties and included help from several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Winter Springs Police Chief Matthew Tracht said at a news conference on Sunday.           Tracht said investigators worked 16- to 18-hour days so they could bring closure in the case. The search for Rucker came to an end on Saturday, when authorities informed her family of the discovery of her body.     Father seeks answers after death of his son on day he was supposed to be released from jail         Orange County Sheriff John Mina said Sunday that deputies responded to a storage unit facility in Apopka, about 20 miles northwest of Orlando, around 5 p.m. Saturday after they received a 911 call about a smell coming from one of the units.           When deputies opened the unit, they found a woman later identified as Rucker dead from apparent gunshot wounds, Mina said. Her official cause of death is still pending as investigators await an autopsy result, Mina added.           Authorities named Hill, 51, as the prime suspect after investigators learned the unit Rucker was located in was registered to him, Mina said.           CNN has reached out to the public defender listed as legal representation for Hill.           The sheriff added that officials believe the shooting happened at the storage unit, and a motive is still undetermined.           Hill was booked in the Orange County Jail on November 13 for an unrelated shooting, Orange County Jail records show. Hill has been charged with four counts of attempted murder after allegedly shooting at a former girlfriend and her family on November 12, Mina said at the news conference.     CNN’s Ashley R.

us,Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/israel-hamas-qatar-hostage-agreement-analysis/index.html,"       The Gaza hostage deal represents a rare moment of humanity in a savage conflict that has inflicted unfathomable violence on both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.           For the child and female hostages expected to be released during a pause in the fighting and their families, it represents everything — a chance of life seven weeks after a Hamas terror attack on Israeli soil slaughtered 1,200 people.           There were growing hopes, for example, on Tuesday night that American Avigail Idan, who turns four on Friday and whose mother and father were murdered in the attacks on October 7, could be among the first released.           “I am very hopeful, our family is hopeful, it’s been 45 days since (Avigail) was abducted and taken to Gaza,” her great aunt Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “It’s excruciating. For our family, we have spent the last seven weeks – seven weeks – worrying, wondering, praying, hoping.”     Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages         The hours to come will be agonizing for loved ones waiting for their relatives – and even more so for those whose family members are not on the list to be freed in this preliminary arrangement. Much remains uncertain, including when the pause will start, how and when hostages will start to emerge and if the agreement will last.           The complex agreement was brokered by Qatar, which served as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel in exhaustive negotiations with the close involvement of the United States, and was endorsed by the Israeli cabinet early Wednesday local time.           It will likely require similar attention from all involved to implement in a vicious war zone and it will be at risk of unravelling at any moment. This is because of a vacuum of trust between two bitter enemies and the extreme logistical challenges of extracting hostages from a territory that waited weeks for the arrival of a few aid trucks amid a raging Israeli offensive.           The carefully choreographed plan would see the release of at least 50 women and children held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for a four-day truce in Israel’s air and ground campaign against the Islamist group, an Israel government statement said. The announcement also held out the potential for the truce to extend beyond the original four-day period, given that an extra day could be added for each 10 additional hostages available for release. Hamas said in a statement that 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails.           Nothing is certain until the hostages start coming out. And the sequencing of the agreement means there will be a constant risk of incidents that could disrupt it.           But the weeks of negotiations at least proved that intense diplomatic efforts can accomplish something concrete, even if the agreement is far from the ceasefire that Israel’s critics are demanding internationally after a conflict that produced harrowing scenes of Israeli kids killed in their beds and Palestinian hospitals under Israeli fire.           The deal is the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the Hamas attacks, and may temporarily ease some of the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose legacy will now be forever tarnished by October 7.           The White House will greet the deal as a significant victory and a first success after weeks of painstaking personal engagement by President Joe Biden and top foreign policy and intelligence officials that threatened to go nowhere. Biden held multiple phone calls with Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. His envoy, Brett McGurk, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were intimately involved in the region. The Israeli leader said Tuesday that the president had been responsible for improving the deal at critical moments.           The agreement, even if it fully delivers on its potential, is unlikely to permanently ease Netanyahu’s tenuous political plight. He’s trapped between the extreme right-wing coalition members he chose as a last resort to cling to power and an Israeli public that blames him for the Hamas attacks. And Biden has already absorbed considerable domestic political damage for his steadfast support for the Israeli response. Heart-rending video of civilian carnage in Gaza has caused some young and Arab American voters in the Democratic base to revolt, furthering weakening Biden’s shaky electoral coalition with his reelection race heating up.           The impending hostage release deal is also the latest example of Qatar’s capacity to play on all sides of a treacherous regional power game. Home to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the oil rich Arab nation also hosts a vast US air base that is critical to American national security – a duality that reflects the Emirate’s emerging role as a Middle Eastern power with wider aspirations.           There will be some hope that the agreement, if honored by both sides, could lead to further breakthroughs and improve the prospects for more hostages still captive in Gaza. Their continued incarceration – presumably in dark tunnels beneath the war-torn enclave – tempered the sense of euphoria about those who are expected to be freed.           The first step for the precarious agreement will be gathering the hostages and facilitating their transfer and initiating the pause in fighting and the entry into Gaza of humanitarian aid under the deal. The potential for snags is ever present. As Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli peace activist who once acted as a channel to Hamas, put it on Tuesday: “You have to remember Israel is negotiating with people who it intends to kill — there is no trust between the parties.”           The hostage breakthrough – and the expected release of a fraction of those captured by Hamas on October 7 – raises the question of what happens to those left behind. The answer will be tough for their loved ones to hear.           “If it took this long to get women and children out, what does it look like for the Israeli soldiers that are being held?” said Christopher O’Leary, a former US government director of hostage recovery. “It could be a very protracted period that they are held, which is why going back on offensive military operations after this tactical pause is going to be required,” O’Leary told CNN International’s Richard Quest.           Even so, international expectations might subtly shift during the truce, making a resumption of Israel’s offensive harder than Netanyahu might wish.           Longer term, hopes that a broader peace initiative could grow from this small first step risk being undercut by the searing reality of the conflict.           Israel believes it is fighting an existential war not just for its national survival but for that of the Jewish people. Hamas fighters in Gaza are fighting against obliteration or embracing martyrdom and while the group’s leaders might seek to leverage remaining hostages for thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails, the most likely scenario is a fight to the finish in Gaza after the pause ends. This would inevitably mean new Israel Defense Force advances on Palestinian population centers and more deaths among trapped civilians that will further exacerbate the brittle international situation inside Israel, the US and elsewhere.           “There is no scenario to end this war without Israel making sure Hamas is no longer in control of their territory. That means killing all their operatives and their leaders, their political and military leaders,” Baskin told CNN Max.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

With Maloy’s victory, House Republicans will return to a 222-213 majority, giving Speaker Mike Johnson some breathing room as he faces a looming government spending fight, though he still controls only a very narrow majority. But that may be temporary, with members weighing a possible expulsion of Republican Rep. George Santos.           Maloy will defeat Democratic state Sen. Kathleen Riebe in the reliably red district that covers the western portion of the state, stretching from the Salt Lake City area to St. George. She will succeed her onetime boss, former GOP Rep. Chris Stewart, and will be the first woman in Utah’s congressional delegation since Republican Mia Love left office in 2019.           Stewart left office in September over his wife’s health concerns. Maloy, who worked as a counsel in Stewart’s Washington office, had his endorsement on her way to securing the GOP nod. She advanced to the September primary by winning a nominating convention in June. She then won a three-way primary contest, besting former state Rep. Becky Edwards and former Utah GOP Chairman Bruce Hough.           Maloy faced questions over her eligibility for the special election primary ballot related to voter registration issues. She was marked inactive in the state’s voter database because she did not cast a ballot in 2020 and 2022, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, after she relocated to Virginia to work for Stewart. But the state GOP submitted her name for the ballot, noting that no objections to her candidacy were filed before the convention.           On the campaign trail, Maloy often touted her experience as a congressional aide to make the case that she has already been serving the district.           “Congress is struggling right now. Things aren’t going smoothly,” Maloy said at a debate last month. “We really need somebody to get into this seat who knows how Congress works, who knows how to work with people and who already knows this district.”           Maloy, who also made government spending a focus of her campaign, will join a Congress staring down two deadlines in January and February to keep the government funded.           “I’m willing to vote for a spending bill that reduces spending,” Maloy said at the debate when asked whether she would support bipartisan government funding legislation. “As long as we’re cutting spending and moving in the right direction, there’s no need to shut down the government.”           A sizable minority of House Republicans did not back the stopgap measure enacted last week to keep the government open because it did not include the deep spending cuts that conservatives had demanded and instead extended funding at current levels.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Former Trump Org. controller breaks down in tears on witness stand in fraud trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/mcconney-trump-org-testimony-fraud-trial/index.html,"       After four days of testimony and two trips to the witness stand, former Trump Organization controller Jeff McConney broke down in tears on Tuesday, telling the court the toll of the numerous investigations and accusations of misconduct drove him to leave the company he loved working for after 35 years.           “I just couldn’t do it anymore,” McConney said. “I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for.”           The emotional outcry came when Jesus Suarez, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, asked McConney before the lunch break why he left the Trump Org.     Takeaways from the first week of Trump’s defense in the $250 million civil fraud trial         Before answering the question McConney took a long pause, removed his glasses, and threw his arms in the air. Trump attorney Alina Habba motioned to a court officer to bring him a box of tissues. Judge Arthur Engoron gave her a thumbs up.           He apologized for his emotional reaction, “Sorry.”           The former long-time Trump Org. controller, who is a co-defendant in the civil fraud trial, said being subjected to several subpoenas and testifying in connection to multiple government cases accusing him of wrongdoing had taken a toll on him.           Pausing at times to wipe his eyes, McConney gave a lengthy answer describing his love for working for the company and ​said he​ remains proud of his 35-year career.           “I feel proud of what I did. I think everything was justified. Numbers don’t represent fully what these assets are worth,” McConney said. “I got to do a lot of things normally an accountant wouldn’t be able to do. I’m very proud of the work I did for 35 years.”           But after several years of investigations accusing him of inflating asset valuations on Trump’s financial statements, he grew frustrated and said, “I gave up.”           McConney acknowledged on cross examination that he’s received all but $125,000 of a $500,000 severance package from Trump Org.           Assistant New York Attorney General Andrew Amer pushed back on McConney’s testimony that it was the outside accounting firm Mazars that wrote most of the notes and disclaimers on Trump’s personal financial statements.           McConney, under questioning from a Trump attorney on Monday, shifted the blame to Mazars and Donald Bender, ​who he says reviewed and could have advised them about any inflated asset values on Trump’s personal financial statements that are at the heart of the civil fraud trial.           Amer showed McConney a collection of his own handwritten edits on the statement drafts that he had attributed to Mazars in earlier testimony.           At one point while reviewing his own handwritten notes, McConney acknowledged his memory was “incorrect” about a specific disclosure on Trump’s statement. Seeing the handwritten edits also published in the final statement version, he acknowledged he must have primarily written the disclosure about asset valuations that deviated from generally accepted accounting principles.           Amer also suggested McConney was involved in the financial statements as recently as 2021 although he testified earlier at trial that he passed off the duty to another accounting executive Patrick Birney around 2016.           Amer showed the court handwritten notations from McConney on 2021 financial statement drafts.     Judge temporarily lifts gag order in Trump’s civil fraud trial         Among the 2021 notes, the former controller wrote that Eric Trump needed to review the footnotes for the section on club facilities. On another page McConney wrote that Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr, both defendants in the case, should review the statements.           McConney eventually said, “I had a little bit of input.”           McConney said he did the best he could to make the notes on his spreadsheets accurate “to let the reader of the spreadsheet know where the numbers were coming from.”           The trial will resume Monday after the Thanksgiving break with Trump Hotels CFO Mark Hawthorn expected to testify.           Deutsche Bank lenders who worked with Trump Org. on several loans at issue in this case are expected to testify under subpoena next Tuesday.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

us,"Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/negotiations-israel-hamas-hostages/index.html," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu grabbed Brett McGurk’s arm as he walked out of a tense meeting of the Israeli Cabinet over securing the release of hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza.     “We need this deal,” Netanyahu told the White House Middle East coordinator a week ago in Tel Aviv, according to sources familiar with the exchange.         Earlier that day, Netanyahu and President Joe Biden had agreed over the phone that they were ready to accept the broad contours of a deal for Hamas to release 50 women and children who were being held hostage.         A major breakthrough had come two days earlier on November 12. Hamas – after refusing for days – had relented in offering identifying information about several dozen hostages, such as their age, gender and nationalities. The information confirmed that numerous children and toddlers had been taken captive on October 7.           Even though Israel and the US believed there were more than 50 women and children hostages, both sides agreed that they needed to move ahead with securing the release of those 50 – and hope that the deal might incentivize Hamas to release more after the initial group.           But hours after McGurk’s meeting with Netanyahu, everything went dark.           The Qataris – who had been playing the main mediating role – couldn’t get a hold of Hamas. When the group finally resurfaced, Hamas threatened to derail the talks: It demanded that the Israel Defense Forces, which had gone in to raid Al-Shifa hospital, leave the hospital grounds. IDF declined but indicated that it would keep the hospital running.           Once the talks resumed, Biden – who was in San Francisco having just finished a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping – placed one more call to the emir of Qatar. His message: Time was up. The emir gave Biden his assurances that he would do everything possible to close the deal.           The next day, McGurk met in person with the emir in Doha to examine the text of the final deal that by this point was around half a dozen pages long. It laid out how women and children would leave in the first phase, as well as incentives for Hamas to release more hostages beyond that. CIA Director Bill Burns was dialed in to the meeting by phone.           Israel’s war cabinet approved the deal after making minor changes on Sunday, and the text of the agreement was passed on to Hamas for the last time by the emir of Qatar.           The emir made clear: This is the final offer.           On Tuesday morning, Hamas responded to their Qatari interlocutors: They approved the deal.           While efforts to negotiate a deal began in the immediate days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the groundwork for the deal started coming together weeks later, after the Biden administration had confidence that communication with Hamas via the Qataris was effective. Officials would later describe this as their “pilot” negotiation.           On October 23, the White House had successfully secured the release of two American citizens from Gaza – Natalie and Judith Raanan. As the mother and daughter made their way across Gaza, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer and McGurk were huddled in Sullivan’s office, tracking the Raanans’ movements in real time. Sources described their multi-hour journey as “excruciating.”           When the women arrived at the border, Charge d’Affaires Stephanie Hallett was waiting for them. At this point, Biden placed a call to Natalie Raanan’s father to share the joyful news, and later in the day, he would speak with both women.           That day would serve as proof to Biden’s top national security officials that the White House had successfully established a means of communicating and negotiating with Hamas via Qatar. And it triggered what would ultimately become the weeks-long effort to secure the release of a larger group of hostages.           After the Israelis delegated the director of Mossad to negotiate on the hostages, back in the US, Burns, too, became intimately involved.           In Doha, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani engaged directly with senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, a person familiar with the discussions said.           In multiple phone calls in October, Biden impressed upon Netanyahu that there was a path for a large group of hostages to be released. On October 24, Hamas appeared to agree to the parameters of a deal to release women and children hostages. American and Israeli officials furiously deliberated whether Israel should delay its ground invasion.           Ultimately, Israel wasn’t convinced. At this point, they still had no proof of life of any of the hostages that Hamas claimed to have, and they also didn’t buy Hamas’ claim that they couldn’t determine the identities of the hostages until there was a pause in fighting.           Israel began its ground invasion on October 27.           In the weeks that followed, the US, Israel and Qatar went back and forth with Hamas, negotiating with the group about every detail of a possible deal: the timeframe, number of hostages, safe passage corridors and surveillance.           Blinken returned to Israel in early November to press the Israeli government to accept “humanitarian pauses,” something that the US argued would advance progress on the hostages. Although there was an agreement in principle after Blinken met with Netanyahu and the war cabinet, the Israeli prime minister publicly rejected the idea just hours after that meeting. It took days of pressure from the US for the Israeli government to institute and acknowledge “tactical pauses.”           The talks at times seemed to move painfully slow, as each step of the communication moved from Doha, Qatar, or Cairo to Hamas in Gaza, then back again, before being relayed to Israel and the US.           “Every step of this is like pulling teeth,” one official said at the time.         Behind the scenes, the hostages were the key issue that prevented Israel from initially agreeing to a humanitarian pause, because the Israeli government did not want to signal any kind of relief in exchange for hostages, a senior State Department official said.           Numerous different permutations of a deal were discussed.           Israeli and US officials initially insisted that all women and children come out in the first part of the release. Hamas would only guarantee 50 and refused to produce identifying information about the hostages. By the time that Burns met in Doha with the emir of Qatar and David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, the fact that there was no identifying information about the hostages was a major sticking point.           On November 12, Biden informed the emir of Qatar that the negotiation could not move forward without this information in what a senior administration official described as a “very important and very intense call.” Shortly after, Hamas finally relented, seemingly guaranteeing that any final deal would entail the release of 50 women and children hostages.           While the deal reached this week only returns 50 women and children, US officials projected confidence Tuesday that the agreement will ultimately pave the way for additional hostage releases.           There are 10 Americans who remain unaccounted for, including two women and a 3-year-old girl. Pressed by CNN on the remaining Americans, a senior administration official said the White House remains “determined to get everybody home,” and suggested that the deal is structured to “very much (incentivize) the release of everybody.”           An agreement to release hostages from Hamas would “unlock the potential for delivery of more humanitarian assistance” into Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday.           After their safe passage, the released hostages will be given medical attention in Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, suggesting that some could have longer-term medical needs following six weeks in “abhorrent conditions.” Then there will be efforts to repatriate citizens to their home countries and connect them with their families.           For any American citizens released, Kirby said, after medical care is prioritized, the US State Department will provide consular assistance.           It could be 24 to 48 hours before the Biden administration has confirmation as to whether the two American women and orphaned American 3-year-old were among those released, one US official said.

The chairman and CEO of Chinese video game live-streaming platform DouYu has been arrested, becoming the latest business leader to run afoul of authorities in the world’s second largest economy.           DouYu (DOYU) said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its chief, Chen Shaojie, had been arrested by police in the southwestern city of Chengdu on or around November 16. The company said it had only been informed of the arrest on Monday.           It “has not received any official notice of the investigation against Mr. Chen or the reasons for Mr. Chen’s apparent arrest,” it added, warning that his “ongoing detention and any subsequent related legal proceedings and enforcement actions” could have a material impact on its business.           In a statement posted on Chinese social media on Wednesday, police in Chengdu said a 39-year-old man surnamed Chen was arrested on suspicion of opening a casino. State-run news agency Xinhua cited the statement as confirmation that the DouYu executive had been arrested.           The news came two weeks after the Cover News, a state-owned media outlet , reported that Chen had become unreachable. It cited unconfirmed reports that Chen was being investigated and had been missing for nearly three weeks.     Yet another CEO goes AWOL in China         Chen’s disappearance came about five months after the Cyberspace Administration of China launched an onsite inspection of DouYu to investigate what it called “serious” problems related to the platform, including alleged pornography and “vulgar” content, according to a May statement from the internet watchdog.           Douyu, which means “fighting fish” in Chinese, has also come under scrutiny for allegedly hosting online gambling, which is illegal in mainland China.           Last December, three people running a popular account on the platform were each sentenced to up to six years in prison after being found guilty of “opening casinos” by the Intermediate People’s Court in Chengdu, according to state media.          They had run an online lottery that invited users to place bets, which attracted about 4.4 million users, and collected almost 120 million yuan ($16.9 million), the court said in a statement.           The court described it as the first gambling case involving a live-streaming platform that police had handled under the direct orders of the Ministry of Public Security, suggesting it was of national significance and should serve as “a warning to society.”           In its latest filing, DouYu said it was committed to complying with regulations. The company is currently operating as normal, while working on contingency plans in response to Chen’s arrest, it added.           DouYu, which said in its filing that it could not comment on any pending legal proceedings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.           Chen is one of the latest high-flying executives in China to come under scrutiny by authorities. This year, more than a dozen leaders from industries including technology, finance and real estate have gone missing, faced detention or been subjected to corruption probes.           International consulting firms have also faced rising risks, such as the possibility of raids or detentions of executives.           The developments have had a chilling effect on China’s business community, with some entrepreneurs said to be lying low in response to the uncertainty.           Chen founded DouYu and quickly built it into one of China’s most valuable startups.           Often compared to Amazon’s Twitch service, the Tencent-backed company hosts interactive live-streams of video games while letting users chat in real time and inviting them to watch other content created for its platform.

us,"What is Binance, why is it in so much trouble, and what does it mean for crypto?",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/investing/what-is-binance-and-why-is-it-in-trouble/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News             There are few figures in crypto that have loomed quite as large in the past few years than Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — and the company he founded in 2017, Binance.           Not only is Binance the world’s biggest crypto exchange, it is orders of magnitude larger than its rivals. Up until recently, Binance boasted nearly 60% of the market share for crypto spot trading. Even as that share has waned to closer to 40% since US regulators amped up pressure on the company starting in June, no other exchange even comes close. The Seychelles-based OKX is second in market share at 5.44% and the US exchange Coinbase is third at 5.37%, according to crypto news site CoinDesk.          But Binance’s future at the top of the crypto world is now far from certain as it faces a record $4.3 billion payout to US authorities to resolve criminal charges.     Who is Binance founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the billionaire who wants to ‘rebuild’ crypto?         Zhao on Tuesday resigned as CEO and pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges. US officials called the settlement the biggest-ever corporate resolution involving criminal charges for an executive.           Following a multiyear investigation, US authorities said Binance allowed bad actors on the platform, enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics and terrorist financing.           Further, Binance did not have protocols to flag or report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. As one compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents: ﻿“we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.’”           Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. He also agreed to pay a $50 million criminal fine and a $150 million civil penalty.           “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,” Zhao posted on X. “This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself. Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run.”           Binance, like its infamous former rival FTX, has been quick to point out that it grew its business rapidly in a chaotic, largely unregulated industry.           “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.”           It’s a common refrain among crypto firms who find themselves under scrutiny. But federal authorities have made clear that they’re not going to pull any punches when it comes to corporate crime, in crypto or elsewhere.           Analysts see the settlement as a partial victory for Binance and Zhao.     After a year in FTX’s shadow, the crypto industry is delighting in Bankman-Fried’s conviction         “The avoidance of prison time for CZ and the ability for the exchange to continue operations, albeit without CZ as its CEO, is likely the best outcome given the severity of the accusations against Binance,” said Robert Le, crypto analyst for PitchBook. “Binance’s initial ‘move fast and break things’ approach, which involved offering products that were illegal or entering markets without proper licenses, has led to its current predicament.”           The initial market response to the Binance news was muted, with Bitcoin slipping just over 1% Tuesday afternoon — hardly a blip in the notoriously volatile market.           Investors and entrepreneurs in the crypto space just want to see the industry move on from its early days of idolizing founders.           “The question really is whether or not crypto is actually growing up in a way that is allowing it to have an existence beyond its influential founders who have been shepherding the brand, shepherding the innovation, shepherding the advocacy for these institutions,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert on financial regulation. “That’s something that will have to be seen over the next couple of months.”           Yadav notes that the $4.3 billion deal for Binance reflects its status as a systemically important institution — potentially too big to fail.           “What this plea deal does is give Binance as a chance to live another day,” Yadav said. “I think that reflects a worry that if Binance were to be killed, that would cause further damage to average folks who hold money on it to the industry as a whole.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

us,Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/tech/democrats-accuse-x-elon-musk-hamas-propaganda/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.           More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.           Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.”           One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally.           “Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”           X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations.           On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”           The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.           Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.           Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies.           It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

us,"Paris Hilton’s media company suspends ads on X, one month after agreeing to touted partnership with the platform",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/tech/paris-hilton-x-ads/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Paris Hilton’s entertainment company 11:11 Media has pulled an advertising campaign from Elon Musk’s X just one month after announcing an exclusive partnership with the platform, becoming the latest brand to halt ad spending on the site formerly known as Twitter over concerns about antisemitism and pro-Nazi content on the site.           “11:11 Media made the decision to immediately pull the campaign from the platform,” Bruce Gersh, 11:11 Media’s president and chief operating officer, told CNN on Tuesday.           The decision by Hilton’s company to pull its advertising is a blow to X and the platform’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, who announced a major promotional partnership with Hilton just last month. The deal, which was touted by Yaccarino as a long-term, “official partnership” between Hilton, 11:11 Media, and X, aimed to create “a launchpad for new initiatives in video and live video, live commerce, Spaces, and so much more.” The deal also established a revenue-sharing agreement between the parties.           Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal advertising chief who has been tasked with wooing wary advertisers back to X despite Musk’s tumultuous leadership, declared Hilton the “queen of pop culture” and described the partnership as “a new era” that would reside exclusively on X.           A spokesperson for Hilton declined to comment on whether the suspension of 11:11’s ad campaign also meant the end of Hilton’s partnership with X. A spokesperson for X also did not immediately respond.           Hilton remains active on the platform via her personal account, @ParisHilton, where she has amassed 16.6 million followers.           The decision by 11:11 Media to pull its advertising campaign from X comes after at least half a dozen brands also paused their ad spending on X last week over concerns about pro-Nazi content and Musk’s embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on the platform.           IBM halted its ad spend on X on Thursday after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters showed its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on X. Other major brands, including Disney and Paramount, followed suit on Friday, but did not specify their reasoning for pulling their ad spending from X.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

us,CEO of world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange pleads guilty to money laundering violations,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/investing/binance-changpeng-zhao-treasury/index.html,"       Billionaire Changpeng Zhao and leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance pleaded guilty on Tuesday to federal charges in a watershed moment designed to bring order to the often-lawless crypto industry.           As part of a coordinated settlement across the federal government, Binance has agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other penalties. Zhao, one of the most powerful figures in crypto, has agreed to step down as CEO from the exchange that he founded, and he will pay $200 million in fines.           Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.           US officials described this as the biggest-ever corporate resolution that includes criminal charges for an executive.           Following a years-long investigation, authorities allege Binance allowed bad actors to freely transact on the platform, enabling everything from child sex abuse and narcotics to terrorist financing for ISIS, Al Qaeda and Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades.           Zhao, who has amassed a fortune estimated at more than $23 billion, pled guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.           US authorities hope the guilty plea from Binance and its founder, on top of the recent conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, will send a clear message to bad actors across the crypto industry.           “Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.           Zhao faces a maximum of 10 years behind bars, though his ultimate sentence will likely be far lower. Federal guidelines likely place the high end of a possible sentence for Zhao around 18 months. Sentencing is ultimately decided by a judge.           According to the plea deal, Zhao agreed to prosecutors’ recommendation that he pay a fine of $50 million. In addition to the criminal fine, Zhao will pay $150 million in civil penalties, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The proposed consent order also requires Binance to disgorge $1.35 billion of ill-gotten gains and pay a $1.35 billion civil monetary penalty to the CFTC.           “Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profits,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers through its platform.”           The Binance guilty plea is part of a coordinated settlement reached with a wide range of government agencies, including the Justice Department, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Treasury described the Binance settlement as its largest enforcement in history.           “The Binance platform was facilitating some truly horrible stuff – everything from terrorist financing to ransomware actions, child pornography and various scams and frauds,” a senior Treasury official told reporters.           US officials say Binance allowed more than 100,000 transactions involving illicit activity as well as more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated US sanctions, including sanctions on Iran, Syria and Cuba.           Just as authorities announced the settlement, Zhao confirmed in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he has stepped down as CEO.           “Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do,” Zhao said. “I made mistakes, and I must take responsibilities. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.”           Zhao will be succeeded by Richard Teng, who previously served as Binance’s global head of regional markets.           “While Binance is not perfect, it has strived to protect users since its early days as a small startup and has made tremendous efforts to invest in security and compliance,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. “Binance grew at an extremely fast pace globally… [and] made misguided decisions along the way. Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter.”           Federal prosecutors unsealed court records on Tuesday alleging Binance, led by Zhao, processed transactions by customers who operated illicit mixing services and “laundered proceeds of darknet market transactions, hacks, ransomware and scams.” Prosecutors allege that Binance had lax anti-money laundering procedures.           This alleged misconduct paved the way for Binance to become king of the crypto exchanges, prosecutors allege.           “In part because of this scheme, and because Defendant prioritized growth, market share and profits over compliance with US law (Binance) became the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” prosecutors said.           Prosecutors allege Binance, “knowingly failed” to register as a money service business, willfully violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and willfully caused violations of US economic sanctions.           The charges, filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, accused Binance of a “deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the US market without implementing controls required by US laws.”           Prosecutors allege the misconduct started as early as August 2017, continued until at least October 2022 and included certain Binance officers, directors, employees and agents.           As Garland detailed the federal government’s investigation into Binance, he mentioned a message that one compliance employee sent in February 2019 that said the crypto exchange oughta get a banner that says: “Is washing drug money too hard these days? Come to Binance, we got cake for you.”           “By failing to comply with US law, Binance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,” Garland said.           Proponents of digital currencies point out that the great majority of business done via crypto is lawful and legitimate, and a cottage industry of companies have emerged in the last five years that work with law enforcement to track digital transactions.           But top US officials made it crystal clear Wednesday that they’ll continue to keep a close eye on illicit activities surrounding crypto.           “Today’s actions show that if you serve US customers, you must comply with US law,” said Nicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general. “US financial institutions are the gatekeepers for the safety and security of our financial system and because Binance serves a substantial amount of US customers, it was a US financial institution that was required to comply with anti-money laundering laws.”           Binance’s legal woes follow the collapse of another crypto exchange, FTX, and the conviction of it founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Those are the most extreme examples of the greater scrutiny that law enforcement and regulators have brought in recent months to the largely unregulated crypto industry.           But ransomware gangs from Russia and money launderers from North Korea, for example, continue to see crypto as core to their business model, and have often used publicly available tools, or “mixing services,” to hide their ill-gotten gains.           The US Justice Department in August unsealed federal charges against the co-founders of one such service, Tornado Cash, accusing them of moving $1 billion in cryptocurrency for criminals. One of the Tornado Cash co-founders has pleaded not guilty to the charges while the other remains at large.           Officials said they are taking an aggressive, whole-of-government approach to rooting out financial crimes via crypto.           “You have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms … or [that] don’t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said.           Monaco pointed to the creation of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department as an example that the feds mean business, including how government entities collaborate on investigating crimes involving crypto.           Some think more needs to be done.           “Regrettably, today’s settlement is not an outlier, and the lawlessness if not criminal activities of crypto will continue and increase until all prosecutors, regulators and elected officials force the industry to act like all other law-abiding people and firms in the financial industry,” Dennis Kelleher, co-founder, president, and CEO of Better Markets, said in a statement.           Binance was founded in 2017 by Zhao, a Canadian national. US market regulators this year brought civil cases against Binance, which they accuse of running an illegal exchange for unregistered securities in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission in June sued Binance, saying the company ran an “extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.”           Binance has long argued that it isn’t subject to US laws because it doesn’t have a physical headquarters in America.           The SEC also alleged that Zhao and Binance commingled customer assets and even diverted some to an entity controlled by Zhao.           Zhao claims that the company’s headquarters are wherever he is at any point in time, “reflecting a deliberate approach to attempt to avoid regulation,” according to a complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That agency accused Binance and Zhao of violating US derivatives trading laws in multiple ways, including allegedly secretly coaching “VIP” customers within the United States on how to evade compliance controls.           A spokesperson for Binance said in June that the company takes the SEC’s allegations seriously, but it believes the agency’s accusations are “unjustified.”           “We respectfully disagree with the SEC’s allegations that Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or illegally offered and sold securities,” the company said in a statement. “Because of our size and global name recognition, Binance has found itself an easy target caught in the middle of a US regulatory tug-of-war.”     This story has been updated with additional developments.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/22/middleeast/israel-approves-hamas-hostage-deal-intl/index.html,"       Israel and Hamas have reached a breakthrough deal in their ongoing conflict for a four-day humanitarian pause and the release of at least 50 hostages – women and children – held in Gaza, key negotiator Qatar said Wednesday.           The deal, which hinged on approval from Israel’s cabinet and follows weeks of negotiations that included the United States and Egypt, marks a major de-escalatory step nearly seven weeks since Israel declared war on Hamas.           The hostages will be released in exchange for a number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails, Qatar said in a statement. The start of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours.           The pause will also allow the entry of “a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs,” the statement added.           Israel’s cabinet approved the deal in the early hours of Wednesday morning following what an Israeli official told CNN was a “tense and emotional” meeting that lasted about six hours.           Hamas is holding 239 hostages in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 countries, according to figures from the Israeli military. The mass abductions took place during on October 7, when Hamas militants struck across the border in coordinated attacks killing around 1,200 people – the largest such attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.           Just a handful of Israeli hostages have been released prior to the deal. On October 20, two Americans – Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan – were freed on humanitarian grounds following negotiations between Qatar and Hamas.           Soon after, two Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, were also released.           Qatar’s lead negotiator Minister of State Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said the agreement should prompt the international community to “seize this brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track.”           Both Israel and Hamas released their own separate statements earlier Wednesday.           Hamas said in a statement, which it later removed without explanation, that 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails would be released as part of the deal.           Israel’s statement held out the potential for the truce to extend beyond the original four-day period, saying that an extra day would be added for each 10 additional hostages available for release.           But it also made clear that Israel plans to resume its air and ground campaign “to complete the eradication of Hamas” once this round of hostage releases concludes.           The Israeli military is still working out the exact timing of the pause, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN Wednesday morning.           “Until we are told to do so by the Israeli government, we will continue fighting Hamas and when such a deal will come into effect, we will respect that. But we will be very vigilant on the ground,” Conricus said.           The deal followed mounting pressure on the Israeli government from the families of the hostages, who have demanded answers and action from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.           Many of the hostages were seized at gunpoint during Hamas’ rampage of violence though border communities near the Gaza Strip and the nearby Nova music festival.           Israel responded to the attacks by imposing a blockade on Gaza that cut off supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel, and launched a relentless air and ground assault that has plunged the enclave into a dire humanitarian crisis.           More than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the Hamas-run government’s press office.           Even as the details of the release remained unclear, some family members of the hostages held by Hamas expressed relief – and anticipation as they waited to learn whether their loved ones would be included in the negotiated release.           Anat Moshe Shoshany, whose grandmother was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz on the back of a moped, said hearing of the hostage deal gave her “so much hope.”           “I really do hope to see someone walking out of there alive,” Shoshany said. “We want a chance to see our loved ones back. This is all we want and I really hope this is just the first step in this mess.”     Israel agrees to hostage deal with Hamas         Liz Hirsh Naftali, the great-aunt of Abigail Edan, a 3-year-old US citizen being held hostage by Hamas, told CNN that the situation has been “excruciating.”           “We have spent the last seven weeks, seven weeks, worrying, wondering, praying, hoping,” she said.           The family hopes Abigail, who is the youngest American hostage held by Hamas, can come home by Friday, her fourth birthday.          “We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it,” Naftali added.           US President Joe Biden welcomed the deal in a statement Tuesday night in Washington, saying it “should bring home additional American hostages.” He “will not stop until they are all released,” Biden pledged.           Three Americans could be among the 50 women and children freed as part of the deal, senior US officials said. Ten Americans remain unaccounted for, including two women and a 3-year-old girl, according to a senior administration official. The official didn’t name the girl.           While the deal stipulates the release of at least 50 hostages it “incentivizes the release of everybody,” according to the official.           “The hostages deal, as it is structured, includes a pause, a humanitarian pause over a number of days, four to five days at least. And there’s the potential with additional releases for that to be for that to be extended, but that will also be dependent upon Hamas releasing additional hostages,” the official said.           A US official also said there are “various locations where the hostages will be brought out,” but declined to provide further detail.           The IDF spokesperson Conricus said the list of hostages to be released in the deal are all Israelis - some with dual nationalities. He added that the Palestinian prisoners set to be released are “not serious offenders.”           The total number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails is approximately 8,300, according to Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a non-governmental organization.           Of those 8,300, more than 3,000 are being held in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” which means they are being held without knowing the charges against them or an ongoing legal process.     This is a developing story and will be updated.

While the deal stipulates the release of at least 50 hostages it “incentivizes the release of everybody,” according to the official.           “The hostages deal, as it is structured, includes a pause, a humanitarian pause over a number of days, four to five days at least. And there’s the potential with additional releases for that to be for that to be extended, but that will also be dependent upon Hamas releasing additional hostages,” the official said.           A US official also said there are “various locations where the hostages will be brought out,” but declined to provide further detail.           The IDF spokesperson Conricus said the list of hostages to be released in the deal are all Israelis - some with dual nationalities. He added that the Palestinian prisoners set to be released are “not serious offenders.”           The total number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails is approximately 8,300, according to Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a non-governmental organization.           Of those 8,300, more than 3,000 are being held in what Israel calls “administrative detention,” which means they are being held without knowing the charges against them or an ongoing legal process.     This is a developing story and will be updated.

world,North Korea claims to have put spy satellite into orbit. Analysts say that could make its military stronger,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/22/asia/north-korea-spy-satellite-into-orbit-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"       North Korea on Wednesday said it had put its first spy satellite into orbit and vowed further launches to defend against what it called its “enemies’ dangerous military maneuvers.”           Analysts said if the spacecraft works, it could provide signifcantly improve North Korea’s military capabilities, including enabling it to more accurately target opponents’ forces.           The satellite, named “Malligyong-1,” was launched late Tuesday on a new carrier rocket, “Chollima-1,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).           “The launch of a reconnaissance satellite is the legal right of North Korea to strengthen its right to self-defense,” the KCNA report said.           Neither South Korea, the United States nor Japan, all of which are experiencing increasing military tensions with North Korea, could confirm the satellite had made it into orbit.           But South Korea called the launch a “clear violation” of a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits North Korea from using ballistic missile technology.           And Wednesday morning the South Korean government partially suspended an agreement it had with North Korea that limited the South’s reconnaissance and surveillance activities along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries.           The rocket carrying the satellite was launched in a southerly direction and is believed to have passed over Japan’s Okinawa prefecture.           Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch, referring to it as “a serious situation” that “affects the safety” of people in Japan while reiterating his commitment to continue working with the US and South Korea to respond to Pyongyang’s launches.           In a statement Wednesday, Seoul’s military said that it had been tracking preparations for the launch in close cooperation with the US.           The statement said Aegis destroyers from South Korea, the US, and Japan were deployed to track the launch and information about the specifics of it were being comprehensively analyzed.           Japanese Defense Minister Hiroyuki Miyazawa said his country was still trying to determine whether North Korea’s satellite had reached orbit.           Pyongyang first attempted to put a satellite into orbit in late May, but the second stage of the rocket carrying the satellite malfunctioned and it crashed into the sea.           KCNA said “the reliability and stability of the new engine system” was “low” and the fuel used “unstable,” leading to the mission’s failure.           A second attempt failed in August when there was “an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight,” a KCNA report said at the time.           That rocket broke into multiple parts before falling into the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese officials.           In a defiant speech to the UN Security Council after the second failed launch, North Korean Ambassador Kim Song insisted that pursuing the spy satellite program was within the country’s “legitimate right as a sovereign state.” He denied that North Korea had been seeking to acquire intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology through the satellite launch.     North Korea believed to have exported over 1 million shells to Russia         Tuesday night’s third attempt was widely expected and signaled by Pyongyang, which early Wednesday vowed to launch more.           North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration would submit a plan to “secure the capability to reconnoiter the south Korean region … by additionally launching several reconnaissance satellites in a short span of time,” KCNA said.           Pyongyang said having a satellite was a legitimate self-defense measure against what it claims are a series of provocations by the US, South Korea and Japan.           Earlier this week North Korea denounced the US for its potential sales of advanced missiles to Japan and military equipment to South Korea, calling it “a dangerous act” in a report from KCNA.           North Korea said it was “obvious” who the offensive military equipment would be aimed at and used against.           Analysts said even a single satellite in orbit helps North Korea’s military posture.           “If it works it will improve the North Korean military’s command, control, and communications or intelligence and surveillance capabilities. That would improve the North’s ability to command its forces” in any possible conflict, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.           The “satellite will give them a capability that they previously used to lack that can assist them in military targeting, it can assist them in damage assessment,” said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.           And lessons learned from Tuesday’s launch will be used in developing future satellites, Panda said.           “They’re going to take what they learn with this successful launch and apply it to additional launches. They will look to have a resilient, redundant constellation of Earth observation satellites and that will make a pretty big difference for (North Korea’s) overall strategic situational awareness capabilities,” he said.           But others cautioned that the real capabilities of what Pyongyang launched late Tuesday remain to be seen. Some suggested the North had more to lose from the South’s resumption of intelligence gathering along the border than it had to gain from the satellite launch.           “The surveillance drone operations Seoul may soon commence along the DMZ should produce more useful intelligence than North Korea’s rudimentary satellite program,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.     South Korea’s Defense Minister Shin Won-sik last Sunday said that the North was believed to have “almost resolved” its rocket engine issues “with Russia’s help.”           That came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had visited Russia in September, when he toured the Russian space rocket launch site alongside President Vladimir Putin.     In that meeting, Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program.           But Panda cautioned about making assumptions that aid and advice from Russia had made the difference for a successful third launch.           “It would seem unlikely to me given the timeline here that the North Koreans have already received and implemented technical assistance from Russia,” he said.           “Let’s also bear in mind that the North Koreans themselves are remarkably capable at this point.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,The UAE is hosting the world’s biggest annual climate summit. It’s also planning a massive fossil fuel expansion,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/22/climate/uae-cop28-adnoc-fossil-fuels-expansion-climate-intl/index.html,"       In late September, Zimbabwe’s environment minister signed away control over a staggering amount of land — almost 20% of his country — to a little-known foreign company. Blue Carbon was a small, new outfit, not even a year old, but its chief was no fledgling entrepreneur: he was an Emirati royal whose family had ruled Dubai for 190 years, flush with oil money.           The Dubai-based Blue Carbon has secured forested land nearly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom across five African nations to run projects to conserve forests that might otherwise be logged, preventing huge amounts of planet-heating carbon dioxide, or CO2, from entering the atmosphere.           Blue Carbon can then use that conservation to create carbon credits to sell to companies and governments to “offset” the climate pollution they generate while they continue to burn planet-warming fossil fuels.           The flurry of forest conservation deals with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Liberia and Tanzania were announced in the months ahead of the annual United Nations’ COP28 climate summit, being hosted this year in December by the United Arab Emirates. But according to several analysts and climate advocates CNN spoke with for this story, these conservation deals are the latest attempt by the petrostate to use green initiatives as a smokescreen for its plans to continue pumping fossil fuels.           At the same time, the UAE has said it plans to extract its very last barrel of oil 50 years from now, when its reserves are projected to dry up — decades beyond when scientists say society needs to be done with fossil fuel.    A post shared by Blue Carbon LLC (@bluecarbondxb)        A spokesperson would not confirm to CNN that the company would sell those credits to the UAE, but given Blue Carbon’s chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, is a relative of Dubai’s royal ruler — who also serves as the UAE’s prime minister — the widely held assumption among analysts CNN spoke with is that these credits will be sold to the UAE to offset its enormous carbon footprint. They could also be sold to other oil-reliant nations and companies in the Gulf and beyond. CNN has reached out to the UAE government for comment.           Blue Carbon would not confirm to CNN the area size of all its projects, how much money it has provided in financing or how many credits it hopes to generate. The agreements are in initial stages and not yet finalized.           But the company did tell CNN it would present its deals at the COP28 summit in Dubai as a “blueprint” for carbon trading. The annual climate summit is where global leaders and negotiators from nearly 200 countries will convene to decide how and when to ramp down fossil fuel use. The UAE is expected to use its COP28 presidency to push hard to include carbon removal — not just from forests, but also from oil and gas as they burn and then storing it underground — central solution to the climate crisis.     What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it’s a dangerous distraction         Climate advocates have criticized carbon removal — and scientists remain skeptical of its efficacy — as a ticket for companies to continue to produce and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, even expand, and profit handsomely.           The UAE has a lot to lose, financially. Oil and gas account for around 30% of its GDP and 13% of its exports as of last year, according to the US Department of Commerce. More than 80 countries support phasing out fossil fuels, and renewable energy, like wind and solar, are now so cost competitive in most parts of the world that market forces will eventually squeeze oil and gas out anyway.           Unless, that is, fossil fuel companies and lobbyists can convince the world at COP28 not to rely too much on wind and solar, and to keep pumping oil and gas.           The UAE has already been hit with a barrage of criticism since it put Sultan Al Jaber — who runs the nation’s mammoth oil and gas company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and serves as the nation’s international climate envoy — in charge of the negotiations. More than 100 members of the US Congress and the European Parliament in May called for Al Jaber to be replaced as COP28 president.           Al Jaber sees no conflict of interest in his many roles, he has said in multiple interviews. Nor does ADNOC, which told CNN in an email that there was “no one more qualified,” to lead the negotiations, pointing to his experience as leader of the nation’s renewable energy vehicle, Masdar, as well as its fossil fuels oil and gas company.           Al Jaber has long argued that fossil fuel companies need to be at the table in climate negotiations to ensure the green transition actually happens.           There is a certain logic to the argument, but climate advocates aren’t buying it, pointing instead to all the time the fossil fuel industry has had to show leadership on the issue, but hasn’t. Some fossil fuel companies were among the first to understand their products were causing climate change. That was around four decades ago, yet they continued to profit from coal, oil and gas.           “I think that ADNOC has turned the UN climate negotiations into a giant greenwashing operation for one of the largest oil companies on the planet,” said Jamie Henn, founder and executive director of the non-profit Fossil Free Media, which supports the movement to end fossil fuels. “It’s been clear from the start when the UAE applied to host this COP that one of the main goals of the meeting was for them to try and situate themselves, and their oil and gas industry by extension, as somehow part of the climate solution.”           As of 2020, the UAE was responsible for around 0.53% of the world’s CO2 emissions, according to data from Climate Watch, but with a small population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the sixth-largest carbon polluter per capita. Despite its relatively small population, the UAE was the world’s seventh-biggest oil producer by volume in 2022.           Henn said it was “absurd” that the negotiations had been taken over by fossil fuel interests.           “It’s like the international tobacco control negotiations being run by Philip Morris. Luckily, the UN has rules in place for those negotiations, where they don’t let tobacco lobbyists at the table,” Henn said. “We need that at COP.”           Never has a COP, which is hosted by a different city each year, had so many apparent conflicts of interest. Not only is Al Jaber wearing leadership hats for climate and fossil fuels, but Blue Carbon is so intertwined with the nation’s royals and rulers, it’s difficult to separate its promotion of carbon offsets from the UAE’s interest in continuing fossil fuel production.           And it will be in Dubai, at COP28, where the rules of how to buy and sell these very carbon credits will be decided.           When asked by CNN if Blue Carbon was looking at more carbon offset deals in Africa, a spokesperson for the company said that “with COP28 around the corner, we will formally announce a few more of our initiatives.” A source with knowledge of the COP28 agenda told CNN the company would use the deals to promote carbon credits as a bigger part of the climate solution.           It’s not a big surprise that so many countries have signed up to work with Blue Carbon. Its parent company, Global Carbon Investments, has already agreed to transfer $1.5 billion to Zimbabwe in “pre-financing for carbon credits.” That’s more than the country spends on education and childcare, which combined are Zimbabwe’s biggest national expense.           With so little money trickling in from the developed to the developing world to adapt to the climate crisis, carbon credit schemes open a new channel of revenue for forest-rich countries.           Cutting down forests or letting them degrade accounts for at least 12% of global planet-warming emissions. It’s their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that makes them valuable as a climate solution.           Yet the idea of creating tradable carbon credits in exchange for not cutting down forests has been widely criticized as problematic. And some of the world’s biggest companies certifying carbon credits have been shown to use accounting methods that exaggerate their project’s true contribution to mitigating climate change.           In early November, Swiss entrepreneur Renat Heuberger stepped down from his role as CEO of South Pole — one of the world’s first major carbon credit trading companies — after it was found to have overstated the climate value of carbon credits that lay in its Kariba forest project in Zimbabwe.           “Investment in efforts to conserve forests is always welcome. However, the challenge is that conserving forests isn’t a ‘get out of jail free’ card,” said Julia Jones, a conservation scientist at Bangor University in Wales.           “Globally, we need to both stop further loss of forests and drastically cut emissions,” she said. “Using one to offset the other, without very substantial investment in reducing emissions, is problematic.”           Land rights are another issue. In some cases, indigenous and customary landowners have been evicted to clear the way for such projects, as they witness their homes, once deemed nearly valueless, transformed into cash cows for polluting companies and countries.           The Forest Peoples Programme, a non-governmental organization, says that such evictions have become more common in Kenya since it began allocating land for carbon credits.           “Those in control of Africa’s forests stand to earn a lot of money, and corporations appear to be pursuing a new ‘scramble for Africa,’” Justin Kenrick, a senior policy advisor at the Forest Peoples Programme, told CNN in an email. “Meanwhile such ‘conservation’ in Kenya persists with a failed colonial approach of evicting the very communities who know best how to conserve their forests.”           Whatever the outcome at COP28, the UAE’s state-run oil and gas company, ADNOC, stands to emerge a big winner, especially if it can convince the world that its “Maximum Energy. Minimum Emissions” slogan is a viable climate solution, even as global temperatures soar and scientists press for rapid fossil fuel cuts.           An ADNOC spokesperson did not directly answer CNN’s questions on how many people would represent the company at COP28, but dismissed suggestions the company would benefit from the conference as “incorrect” and “baseless.”           ADNOC is expected to hike its oil production by 41% and its gas production by a third by 2030, compared to projections for this year, according to an analysis of industry data by Global Witness, a non-profit focused on environmental justice and human rights. That translates to a 40% rise in its greenhouse gas emissions, Global Witness said.     The world is planning to blow the fossil fuels production limit that would keep a lid on global heating, report says         The production boost contrasts with plans among other oil majors: Shell’s production is projected to remain largely flat in that time, while BP envisions a 25-percent production cut by 2030. ADNOC, by 2030, plans to out-produce both companies.           ADNOC is starting to look like a new international oil major in other ways, too: It’s expanding its portfolio by buying up assets overseas, such as a gas fields in Azerbaijan, and it has teamed up with BP in a bid to buy a 50% stake in Israel’s NewMed Energy, with a focus on gas exploration in areas including the eastern Mediterranean. It is also buying into projects around renewables and chemicals, the company told CNN.           To limit its carbon footprint amid the expansion, ADNOC said in October it plans to capture 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year from its operations by 2030 — a figure Global Witness found was wildly exaggerated in a recent analysis.           ADNOC currently has the capacity for 800,000 metric tons per year, though it hopes to capture another roughly 3 megatons per year through two facilities not yet completed. Even if those facilities do come online, Global Witness calculates it would take ADNOC more than 340 years to capture the amount of planet-heating carbon it is expected to emit between 2023 and 2030, if it captured both the emissions from its operations and those that occur from using its oil and gas.           ADNOC did not address the calculation in its response to CNN, saying only that it had set its ambition “to achieve net zero by 2045 backed by an initial $15 billion allocation.”           “Before this year, most people would have been forgiven for never having heard of ADNOC. The more we learn about this company — whose CEO remember is charged with making meaningful progress on emissions reductions at COP28 — the greater an outlier it becomes,” Patrick Galey, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness, told CNN.           “ADNOC plans not only to produce billions of barrels of oil for decades to come, but it is also positioning itself to be among the most aggressive expanders of oil and gas production out there.”           How much the UAE company expands beyond 2030 will depend on what role negotiators see for carbon capture at COP28, and whether it can find new markets abroad. Ironically, COP28 could be the arena that transforms ADNOC into a global oil major.     CNN’s Bethlehem Feleke contributed to this report from Nairobi.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,Israel considers potential hostage deal with Hamas,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/world/israel-hamas-hostages/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: Israel agrees a hostage deal with Hamas. CNN’s coverage continues here          Israel’s cabinet convened to consider a proposed hostage deal on Tuesday, in a meeting that stretched into the early hours of Wednesday local time, following meetings of the country’s war cabinet and security cabinet.           According to sources familiar with the negotiations, a draft of the proposed deal between Israel, Hamas and the US included the release 50 women and children hostages taken during the October 7 terror attack on Israel, in exchange for a four-to-five day pause in fighting and three Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons for every hostage released. The Palestinian prisoners are also expected to be women and adolescents.           “We are making progress. I don’t think it’s worth saying more, even at this moment, but I hope there will be good news soon,” Netanyahu said as he met with reservists on Tuesday.           US officials close to the negotiations have stressed that while the deal is not done, they are increasingly optimistic and believe the many weeks of difficult work is about to pay off with a hostage release.     Frustrations spill over in Israel as hostage families demand answers from Netanyahu         The hostages to be released are of various nationalities, one source told CNN, adding that the Americans are hoping one of them will be 3-year-old toddler Abigail Edan – the youngest American hostage – whose parents were killed by Hamas. It was not immediately clear how many more – if any – American citizens would be among the 50 hostages that Hamas would initially release under the deal.           The hostages that Hamas offered for initial release are alive, the group says, according to a source familiar with the talks.           The Israeli government aims for at least 50 hostages to be released as part of the deal being mooted Tuesday – 10 per day for five days – an Israeli government source told CNN. The government would be prepared to extend the deal if Hamas is prepared to release more hostages.           Hamas had initially demanded that Israel’s overhead surveillance be stopped for the duration of the multi-day pause in fighting, sources told CNN. During the course of the negotiations, the parties settled on surveillance drones vacating Gaza’s airspace for part of each day. That six-hour window is when Hamas would be expected to try to move the hostages out without giving up their locations.           Under the forthcoming agreement, Hamas would also gather up any additional women and children hostages during the period that fighting has paused – something the group has insisted that it cannot do until a sustained ceasefire is in place. The temporary ceasefire would potentially be extended beyond that for more hostages to be released. But Netanyahu has also made it clear that the war would continue after the end of the pause.           Speaking before the cabinet meeting Tuesday, Netanyahu said the decision to approve the deal is “a difficult decision but it is the correct decision.” He said that Israel’s security agencies support the proposed deal.           “They have made it clear that not only will the war effort not be harmed, it will enable the IDF to prepare for the continuation of the fighting,” he said. Israeli intelligence efforts and the security of IDF troops will be maintained, he also said.           Hamas has demanded hundreds of trucks of aid, much of it fuel, as part of the negotiations. Fuel is key to running its military operations and ventilating the group’s network of underground tunnels in Gaza.           A source familiar with the negotiations said there is hope that with a hostage deal significantly more aid will be allowed into Gaza, with stakeholders working toward a goal of 400 trucks a day.           The deal would come after weeks of painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas and the US, with Qatar playing a major mediating role. Qatar delivered a draft of the hostage deal to the Israelis early Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majid Al-Ansari told CNN.           The implementation of the agreement would not begin immediately and could take at least a day to start, the person familiar said, in part because there are legal procedures that Israel must follow before releasing any Palestinian prisoners.           The release of the prisoners needs to be approved by the Israeli government but that isn’t expected to be an obstacle, one source said. As cabinet officials met inside the Israeli Defense building to discuss the deal late Tuesday, families of the hostages gathered outside with banners and drums.     Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha released after questioning, IDF says         But two far-right Israeli parties, which are members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government, did later suggest that they would not support the hostage deal being considered by the government.           The Religious Zionism party, headed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The suggested deal is bad and we must not agree to it. It’s bad for Israel’s security, for the hostages and for IDF soldiers,” adding, “The only way to return all the hostages is to continue applying military pressure on Hamas until its complete surrender.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party also said it would “find it very difficult to support the deal.”           Both parties’ statement suggested they had not yet seen the full terms of the deal.           Diplomatic sources and government officials, including US President Joe Biden, over the last few days have struck a more optimistic tone about the progress of talks. But the various parties involved had also stressed that any agreement could be derailed by Hamas and developments on the ground in Gaza.           On Monday night, Hamas’ leader said in a statement that the sides are “close to reaching a truce agreement.”           The latest momentum comes just one day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet met with hostage families.           Israel has said there are more than 200 hostages believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza. After the women and children are released, further negotiations to secure the release of other categories of hostages are likely to commence.           Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross are expected to be involved in the release process, including potentially verifying the identity of the hostages in Gaza and of the prisoners in Israel that are part of the exchange, and transferring them across borders. The Swiss organization has previously served as an intermediary in hostage exchanges, including in the release of two pairs of hostages by Hamas last month.           Gershon Baskin, a well-known Israeli peace activist involved in the 2011 release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas custody, said the hostages in Gaza are likely to be moved in Red Cross vehicles to Egypt, where they would be met by Egyptian intelligence. From there they would likely be driven to Israel in ambulances or buses, Gaskin said.           Once in Israel, the hostages will “most likely be provided immediate medical attention,” according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.           “We have to assume that many of them need some sort of medical attention and that they’re being held in abhorrent conditions,” Kirby said.           The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, met on Monday in Qatar with the political leader of Hamas, according to the aid organization.           The ICRC does not take part in negotiations but stands “ready to facilitate any future release that the parties to the conflict agree to,” the organization said.           Senior US officials have been working intensively to secure the release of hostages for several weeks, with the understanding that a handful of American hostages were taken hostage by Hamas. Biden has spoken directly with Netanyahu, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about the issue.           National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday that Biden has been “personally engaged in moving the process forward” and has been receiving updates from the US team involved in the negotiations “usually multiple times a day and jumping in as he felt appropriate to jump in personally.”           Netanyahu said he had asked Biden to help improve the proposed deal and “indeed, it has been improved to include more hostages and at a lower cost.”           Top Biden officials including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, NSC Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk and CIA Director Bill Burns have been engaged “almost hourly” on the efforts to get the hostages out of Gaza, sources said. McGurk most recently traveled to the Middle East for a multi-country trip aimed in large part at making progress on releasing the hostages.

world,Frustrations spill over in Israel as hostage families demand answers from Netanyahu,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/world/gaza-hostages-families-frustrations-netanyahu-intl-hnk/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: Our coverage of the Israel-Hamas hostage release deal has moved here.         Tensions are boiling over in Israel as frustrated families of hostages demand answers from the government about the fate of their loved ones and a deal for their release.           “I demand their commitment that everyone is returning home. All the hostages. We must get answers, and a commitment … in a written form,” said Shai Wenkert, who son Omer is being held hostage in Gaza by the militant group Hamas.           Wenkert spoke to media on Monday, before he and other relatives met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet in Tel Aviv.           So far only a handful of families have met with Netanyahu – infuriating hundreds of other relatives of hostages who say the government isn’t doing enough to free them.           But for some, the meeting only deepened their frustration. Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Chaimi was taken captive, left the meeting early, saying he felt there was no new information on the hostages provided by the war cabinet, including details about a possible deal to release them.           An estimated 239 hostages are being held in Gaza, abducted during Hamas’ bloody October 7 attacks on Israel that killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli military – the largest such attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.           Just a handful of hostages have been released so far. On October 20, two Americans – Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan – were freed on humanitarian grounds following negotiations between Qatar and Hamas.           Soon after, two Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, were also released.     Lifshitz said she “went through hell,” describing being snatched from her home, driven off on a motorbike before being taken to a network of tunnels.           Israel responded to the October 7 attacks by declaring war on Hamas and imposing a blockade of Gaza, plunging the strip into a dire humanitarian crisis. Around 12,700 Palestinians have died since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, which draws its data from Hamas-run health authorities in the Strip.           And while there is still overwhelming support in Israel for the war on Hamas, there is growing criticism of Netanyahu and his administration, who many blame for failing to anticipate the October 7 attack, and for the lack of progress in hostage releases.           Earlier on Monday, public anger spilled over during a committee meeting in the Israeli parliament, with family members of hostages clashing with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and other far-right government figures.           Ben-Gvir, a divisive figure in Israeli politics who wants Israel to annex the Palestinian territories, is promoting legislation that would see the death penalty handed down to terrorists.     Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu battles on all fronts, amid growing pressure to free hostages         But many hostage families accuse Ben-Gvir of endangering their loved ones further, arguing that Hamas could be less willing to release hostages if there is suggestion that Israel might execute Palestinian prisoners.           In the parliament meeting, family members held pictures of their loved ones and vented their frustrations aloud. “Bring them home!” chanted Gil Dickmann, whose cousin is being held in Gaza.           “Maybe instead of talking about the dead, talk about the living. Stop talking about killing Arabs. Talk about saving Jews. This is your job!” shouted Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were taken on October 7.           Almog Cohen, a colleague of Ben-Gvir in the Jewish Power party, fired back at family members. “You don’t have a monopoly on pain. We also buried more than 50 friends,” Cohen said.           Ben-Gvir’s proposed legislation is making its way through parliament. It still has several stages to pass before becoming law and could yet be withdrawn.           Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement on Telegram that the group was “close to reaching a truce agreement” with Israel, following weeks of negotiations between the United States, Israel and Hamas, mediated by Gulf state Qatar.           The statement came after Hamas had delivered a response to mediators in Qatar. “The movement delivered its response to the brothers in Qatar and the mediators, and we are close to reaching a truce agreement,” Haniyeh said.           Haniyeh did not provide additional details about the potential agreement.           In recent days, sources told CNN a possible deal to secure the release of some hostages and a temporary pause in fighting may be in sight. An agreement has yet to be struck, with several sticking points left to work through – though negotiators are expressing rare optimism, sources say.           Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed two goals of the war – the release of all hostages, and the destruction of Hamas. Israel has rejected international calls for any ceasefire without the return of hostages.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,"Exclusive: ‘Act now’ to keep US competitive in space race, senators say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/world/senators-faster-faa-approval-commercial-space-flight-scn/index.html,"       The top two lawmakers on the US Senate’s space and science subcommittee are pushing federal regulators to accelerate the approval of commercial space launches, arguing that the current pace could cost the United States its edge in the new space race.           In a letter sent last week to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration’s commercial spaceflight office, Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Eric Schmitt implored FAA associate administrator Kelvin Coleman to “act now” to eliminate red tape and reduce delays in processing launch and return to Earth — or reentry — licenses.           “As the pace of launches from U.S. commercial spaceflight companies increases and China’s state-backed space industry continues to grow, it is imperative that the processes at the FAA and other federal agencies adapt to keep pace with American innovation as well as adversarial threats in space,” the senators wrote in a letter dated November 14.           The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is responsible for protecting public safety while simultaneously greenlighting a growing number of commercial space launches, which have quadrupled in just four years. The FAA has already licensed 104 launches this year, compared to 26 launches in 2019.           “Keeping pace with industry demand is a priority and is important for several reasons, including meeting our national security and civil exploration needs,” an FAA spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Tuesday.  “We’re working diligently to attract, hire and retain additional staff.”           In their letter, the senators named NASA’s commercial partners involved in the agency’s flagship human spaceflight program and urged Coleman to fast-track “high priority missions such as returning Americans to the moon.”           Elon Musk’s SpaceX is responsible for developing the lunar lander — called Starship — that will ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. During a hearing last month before the Senate space and science subcommittee, a top SpaceX executive accused government regulators of stifling the company’s progress on Starship, a pivotal part of NASA’s Artemis program and the most powerful rocket ever built.           “It’s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we’re not able to go fly because of regulations or review,” said William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president for build and reliability, noting that the company had been ready for more than a month to launch the next Starship test flight. “Licensing, including environmental (review), often takes longer than rocket development. This should never happen. And it’s only getting worse.”           The remarks came as SpaceX was the subject of a lengthy environmental review by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a safety review by the FAA after the company’s first test flight of its massive moon rocket exploded about four minutes after lifting off in April. Regulators gave SpaceX the green light to proceed last week, and the company completed a partially successful second test flight on Saturday.           In the letter dated the day before the FAA granted the launch license for Starship’s second test flight, Chairwoman Sinema, an independent from Arizona, and Senator Schmitt of Missouri, the top Republican on the subcommittee, told Coleman they were “troubled” by witnesses saying regulatory delays could enable China to continue to close the once-wide gap between itself and the US in space. Beijing is leading a parallel effort to NASA’s Artemis program by attempting to land Chinese astronauts on the same region of the moon and at roughly the same time.           “It is no secret that the United States is in a space race with China — our chief economic and military adversary. We cannot be our own worst enemy when it comes to beating China to the moon and Mars,” Schmitt told CNN.           The senators are now asking Coleman to respond to several questions, including what additional resources he may need to accelerate the launch licensing process, by November 28.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Go Nakamura/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/world/spacex-nasa-starship-artemis-moon-lander-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         Mere moments after SpaceX’s Starship system — the most powerful rocket ever built — was lost in a test flight Saturday, a somewhat complicated narrative around the vehicle began to emerge.           The company immediately described the flight as a huge step in the right direction.           “What we did today will provide invaluable data to continue rapidly developing Starship,” SpaceX said Saturday in a statement. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.”           Yet the loss of another Super Heavy rocket booster and Starship spacecraft highlights just how far they have left to go in the development process, even as significant progress is made. It also raises questions about whether SpaceX can meet some key deadlines on the horizon.           Enabling humans to colonize the cosmos is the ultimate goal for this vehicle: SpaceX intends to use it to send people to the moon, Mars and beyond.           Crucially, the Starship spacecraft is also the vehicle that NASA selected to land US astronauts on the moon for the first time in five decades as part of its Artemis program. The space agency is racing against China to get the job done, vying to become the first to develop a permanent lunar outpost and set the precedent for deep-space settlements.           The first lunar mission that would make use of Starship — Artemis III — is slated for late 2025. In the aftermath of the first failed test flight in April, NASA officials expressed concern that the vehicle wouldn’t be ready in time.           But federal officials reacted favorably to Saturday’s test launch. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson offered SpaceX his congratulations and noted “test is an opportunity to learn — then fly again.”           And to be clear, Starship is still an essential part of NASA’s moon-landing plan. However, there are numerous daunting technological hurdles left to clear before those lunar ambitions becomes reality.           Several key aspects of the second flight test went to plan: When the rocket took off from the SpaceX Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, just after 8 a.m. ET, it was able to ignite all 33 of its engines and continue firing them as the Super Heavy booster — which gives the initial burst of power at liftoff — burned through most of its fuel.           The Starship spacecraft was then able to ignite its own engines and break away from the Super Heavy rocket booster to continue the mission. And the launchpad that served as the starting point managed to survive the sheer force of a rocket generating up to 16.7 million pounds of thrust (7,590 tonnes of force).           None of those milestones were met during the vehicle’s inaugural integrated test flight in April.           But other important steps originally slated for Saturday’s mission didn’t happen. The Super Heavy booster experienced a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” — or an unintentional explosion — shortly after Starship separated from it. The mishap prevented SpaceX from testing the maneuvers that will be necessary to land and reuse the launch vehicle.           Similarly, the Starship capsule made it roughly 10 minutes into its flight, reaching an altitude considered to be beyond the edge of space — about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above Earth’s surface — but SpaceX was forced to terminate the mission when ground control lost its signal.           The vehicle did not spend as much time in space as the company had hoped, collecting mere moments of flight data rather than the hour-and-a-half’s worth mapped out for the mission. John Insprucker, principal integration engineer at SpaceX, said during the livestream that the company had to trigger Starship’s self-destruct feature after contact with the vehicle was lost.           That meant SpaceX wasn’t able to test out Starship’s landing technique either.           “The hardest part about this — or the part that will take the longest — is solving for safe (Starship) reentry and landing,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk acknowledged in October during the International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijian.           Being able to recover and rapidly reuse both the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster are essential to SpaceX’s long-term goals. Such capabilities would make the rocket system affordable and nimble enough to rapidly conduct all the launches necessary to get the vehicle to the moon.           In order to reach lunar orbit, Starship must be refueled while it’s parked near Earth. That’s because the massive spacecraft won’t have enough propellant left over to traverse the 238,900-mile (384,472-kilometer) void between our home planet and the moon after the initial launch process.           As of now, SpaceX acknowledges it has to launch more than a dozen Starship tankers to refuel one spacecraft destined for the moon, said Wayne Hale — the chair of the NASA Advisory Council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee — in a Saturday interview. That’s because of the Starship’s immense size: Just getting the vehicle into space requires it to burn through the majority of its fuel. And while Starship can hold up to 3 million (1,500 metric tons) of propellant, the spacecraft itself is only capable of hauling up to 55,000 pounds (250 metric tons) of extra cargo to orbit, according to data published by SpaceX and the FAA.           “So they’ve got to take that rocket that we saw demonstrated … and be able to fly 12, 15 more times for each lunar landing,” Hale told CNN. “That’s gonna be an impressive feat. They’ve got to learn how to do that … where it’s successful and reliable every time, and they’ve got to do that in a very short period of time.”           With many milestones left to hit, it’s clear that even if the next Starship test flight is wholly successful, a moon landing will remain on the distant horizon.           Musk previously acknowledged in 2020 that he hopes SpaceX will launch “hundreds of missions” with satellites before attempting a flight with crew. SpaceX also must build and test the versions of Starship that will serve as refueling tankers. A lander must be outfitted with life support equipment. And NASA will require Starship to make an uncrewed test landing on the moon before allowing its astronauts on board.           Still, SpaceX emphasized that explosive failures can be integral to its development process, which embraces fiery mishaps in the early stages of designing a rocket in order to learn how to build a better rocket faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests.           Though SpaceX’s failed test flights garner plenty of critics, it does not mean that the company is moving more slowly or costing more money than if NASA had attempted to develop a lunar lander itself.           All told, NASA will pay SpaceX about $4 billion for two lunar landings. (The company has already invested more than $3 billion in developing its South Texas launch facility and the Starship Super Heavy launch system since 2014, according to an FAA court filing dated May 19.)           For comparison, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft that NASA developed for the Artemis program have together cost more than $44 billion since 2006, according to data aggregated by the nonprofit Planetary Society. That rocket system had its first flight test last year. Under NASA’s current plans, SLS and Orion would transport astronauts from Earth to lunar orbit, while Starship would complete the final leg of the journey, ferrying them from the Orion spacecraft to the moon’s surface.           But Hale noted that SpaceX doesn’t use the same development approach as NASA. The space agency spends years on careful design and rigorous ground testing — all but guaranteeing success on the first flight. In contrast, SpaceX wants to put early prototypes in the air, accepting that they may explode but will likely provide valuable information for future testing.           “This is a different paradigm,” Hale said of Starship development. “The government — when you’re working with the taxpayers’ dollars — you really want to be careful and make sure you succeed.           “Whereas (SpaceX) is a private company,” Hale added. “Yes, they’re doing this work in support of the government, but their methodology is quite different. And I think you could be successful either way. But, this way certainly has its exciting moments.”           Starship can also be compared with Blue Moon, another lunar lander under development by the Jeff Bezos-owned space company Blue Origin. NASA selected Blue Moon as an alternative lunar lander for future Artemis missions.           NASA expects to pay the company $3.4 billion for a single crewed lunar landing — the Artemis V mission currently slated for 2028 — with Blue Origin investing at least that much of its own money.           Lakiesha Hawkins, the deputy to the deputy associate administrator for NASA’s moon to Mars program, said at its advisory council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting last week that Blue Origin’s lunar lander won’t necessarily be simpler than SpaceX’s behemoth rocket and spacecraft system.     Apollo 17 astronauts collected rocks that reveal the moon’s true age         “Both of those providers have their challenges,” Hawkins said, referring to SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander. “And they are equally — from my perspective — complex.”           Blue Origin declined to comment on where Blue Moon stands in the development process.           The companies are taking very different approaches in their moon landing strategies, but experts say both SpaceX and Blue Origin will be distinct from their predecessor in some key ways.           Hale, the committee chair, said it can be difficult for members of the public to wrap their heads around why all of these projects are costing so much development time and money if NASA already knows how to put humans on the moon.           Why not just repeat the same thing NASA did during the Apollo program?           “People ask what was wrong with Apollo,” Hale said during the committee meeting last week. “The thing that was wrong with Apollo was it ended.”           NASA and SpaceX are aiming to develop vehicles that don’t just go to the moon once. Apollo already accomplished the “flags and footprints” missions, Hale noted.           Now, the space agency is looking to develop rockets and spacecraft that can push exploration further. NASA aims to establish a permanent moon base and eventually reach Mars in a cost-effective manner.           “When you put those sustainable reusability requirements on the program — and the fact that it’s leading on to go to Mars — you do buy into perhaps a more complicated architecture than just repeating Apollo,” Hale said.           And, even as he acknowledged Starship has a long way to go, he added, “I think they made a big step forward.”           Musk has already said the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft will likely be ready for a third test flight in “3 to 4 weeks,” according to a Sunday post on social media, adding, “There are three ships in final production.”           CNN noted that four Starship spacecraft and at least two Super Heavy boosters are visible from public roadways near SpaceX’s facility in South Texas.           It’s not clear, however, how long it will take SpaceX engineers to review the data gathered during Saturday’s flight and implement the necessary changes. And Musk is known to publicize unmet deadlines.           Also unclear is whether SpaceX will have the necessary regulatory approvals to launch another test flight in just a few weeks. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, indicated its intentions to open a standard mishap investigation into Saturday’s test flight. After the first test flight in April, a similar investigation took over four months to complete.           Once the investigation is closed, the federal agency will then likely need to complete a safety review of SpaceX’s plans for a third launch before it will issue another permit. It’s not clear how long that process might take.           The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

And Musk is known to publicize unmet deadlines.           Also unclear is whether SpaceX will have the necessary regulatory approvals to launch another test flight in just a few weeks. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, indicated its intentions to open a standard mishap investigation into Saturday’s test flight. After the first test flight in April, a similar investigation took over four months to complete.           Once the investigation is closed, the federal agency will then likely need to complete a safety review of SpaceX’s plans for a third launch before it will issue another permit. It’s not clear how long that process might take.           The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,Study reveals first mammal known to mate without using penetration,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/europe/serotine-bats-mammals-sex-mating-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         Bats have long been the odd ones out among mammals.           They are the only creatures in this branch of the animal kingdom capable of powered flight. Now researchers say they have discovered another unique trait, with video revealing that the serotine bat may be the first mammal known to mate without using penetration.           Also known by the scientific name Eptesicus serotinus, serotine bats mate by touching their genitals together. The male bat uses its penis more like an arm to move a protective membrane away from the female bat’s vulva, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology.   Bats have “incredible” reproductive biology that has been difficult to study given the nocturnal and secretive nature of many bat species, said study coauthor Nicolas Fasel, a bat specialist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.           “Most of the time you’ll see their backs on the wall, and you don’t see what’s really happening in front,” he said.     Bats use the same techniques as death metal singers to vocalize, study finds         However, thanks to the efforts of a Dutch bat enthusiast who set up 18 video cameras in a church in the Netherlands that was home to a roosting colony of serotine bats, Fasel and his colleagues were able to analyze 93 mating events in detail. Video of an additional four mating events involving the same species came from collaborators at a bat rescue and rehabilitation center in Ukraine.           “You can really see the copulation and see that the penis is not going inside,” Fasel said.           The footage showed that half of the recorded mating episodes lasted less than 53 minutes, while on one occasion a pair of bats stayed together in a copulative embrace for more than 12 hours. The behavior is similar to a “cloacal kiss,” a way of mating used by many birds.           What Fasel and his colleagues observed on the videos may solve a long-standing puzzle about the reproductive biology of this species of bat, and others in the same family.           The male bat’s penis is around seven times longer than its female counterpart’s vagina, and it has a heart-shaped head that is seven times wider than the vaginal opening. These are features that appear to make penetrative sex difficult, if not impossible, Fasel noted.           Teri Orr, an assistant professor and specialist in bat reproductive systems at New Mexico State University, said she was initially “astonished” to see that males may be using their genitalia as a “copulatory arm” and “maybe transferring sperm much as birds do.” Orr was not involved with the study.           “Bats use their uropatagia (tail membranes) in many unique ways such as fishing nets, to catch pups during birth and so forth and thus they are useful in many ways but perhaps an impediment during mating,” Orr said.     How zoology got female animals all wrong         “I agree that the male of this species may use his genitalia to navigate the female’s tail but there are some key things to be sorted out,” she added via email. “For one: how is the sperm transferred exactly and for another what is the female doing in this pair?”           The behavior of the serotine bat reported in the paper is “bizarre and unique” if true, said Alan Dixson, a biology professor at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and the author of the 2021 book “Mammalian Sexuality: The Act of Mating and the Evolution of Reproduction.” However, in his view, the researchers hadn’t provided sufficient evidence to support their unusual claim, added Dixson, who also was not a part of the study.           Study coauthor Susanne Holtze, a senior scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, acknowledged that they had not been able to definitively prove the transfer of sperm from male to female bats and said that will be a focus of future research.           “It’s a bit of an open question how their semen really gets into the female reproductive tract. It might be that there’s kind of suction involved. We cannot fully answer this mechanism,” she said.           Holtze, who specializes in assisted reproduction in animals, said that the information they uncovered during the study would help with her work to come up with a way to artificially inseminate bats.           “There are more than 1,000 species of bats, and many of them are also endangered, she said. “So far, no sufficient strategy for assisted reproduction has been established.”           Orr, the bat specialist at New Mexico State University, said the study would inform her lab’s work on bat reproduction and whether the unusual reproductive behavior has any implications for understanding human infertility.           “Bats do a lot of extreme things during reproduction from storing sperm to extending the duration of a pregnancy,” she explained.           There are few bat biologists, and most tend to focus on the more obvious yet still fascinating aspects of bat biology such as flight and echolocation, “rather than what the bats are doing ‘behind closed doors,’” Orr said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Visualizing the Israel-Hamas war,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/10/world/map-israel-hamas-war-dg/index.html,"       As fighting and devastating loss continues across Gaza and Israel, CNN is visualizing the war through maps, charts and more.           The conflict began when Hamas militants launched their deadly cross-border surprise attack on Israel on October 7, in what has been described as the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. In response, Israel responded with air and land attacks on the Gaza Strip.           Gaza has one of the youngest populations in the world, with 47% under 18 years old.           Thousands more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7 than  in conflicts with Israel over the last 15 years.           Meanwhile, crossfire at Israel’s border with Lebanon could be the launching pad of a regional war, as communities in northern Israel have emptied out amid fears that the war could spread.           The Israeli army began its full ground operation in Gaza on Oct. 27, moving tanks, bulldozers, infantrymen and combat engineer units into the strip.           Gaza’s fuel crisis affects its ability to generate power, which was already inadequate before the siege.           Gaza’s main sources of electricity are its single power plant in Deir al-Balah and from Israeli lines, which make up nearly two-thirds of Gaza’s power supply.           The tunnel systems under Gaza are best known as passageways used to smuggle goods from Egypt and launch attacks into Israel. But there’s another passageway underground that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) colloquially refer to as the “Gaza metro.” It’s used to transport people and goods; to store rockets and ammunition caches; and house Hamas command and control centers.           Hospitals in Gaza entered a stage of “actual collapse” due to electricity cuts and fuel shortages, a spokesperson from the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said on October 17.           On October 13, Israel’s military told 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate their homes immediately, as it appeared to prepare to ramp up retaliation for Hamas’ October 7 attack.           As airstrikes in Gaza have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and overwhelm areas, including hospitals, there is little room to go. Across the Middle East, Gaza is among the smallest and most densely-packed cities.           As thousands of rockets have rained down on Israel, the country has been relying once again on the Iron Dome system to protect its citizens.           The US government has spent over $2.9 billion on the Iron Dome program since 2011, according to the Congressional Research Service.

world,"Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha released after questioning, IDF says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/world/mosab-abu-toha-gaza/index.html,"       Palestinian poet and writer Mosab Abu Toha, who had been contributing to The New Yorker and other publications with reflections on his life inside Gaza during the war, has been released from detention after questioning, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).           In a statement Tuesday, the IDF said that Abu Toha was among a group of civilians who was taken into questioning during operations, when “there was intelligence indicating of a number of interactions between several civilians and terror organizations inside the Gaza Strip.”           The poet’s brother, Hamza Abu Toha, recounted the story of his detention in a Facebook post Monday.           Abu Toha was taken into custody by the IDF “when he reached the checkpoint while leaving from the north to the south” of Gaza, reads the post.           “His wife and children entered the south, and the army arrested my brother Mosab,” continues the post. “We have no information about him. It is worth mentioning that the American embassy sent him and his family to travel through the Rafah crossing.”           The circumstances of Abu Toha’s arrest are unclear. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. A US State Department spokesman earlier said he didn’t have information to share on the situation.           An American Book Award winner and finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for his debut poetry book, “Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear,” Mosab Abu Toha, 30, had written searingly about the Israeli airstrikes that have decimated Gaza since war broke out last month between Israel and Hamas.           In a New Yorker essay published on October 20, he described returning to his home in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza, days after evacuating to Jabalia refugee camp, where he had stayed with relatives.           “On the main street leading to my house, I find the first of many shocking scenes. A shop where I used to take my children, to buy juice and biscuits, is in shambles. The freezer, which used to hold ice cream, is now filled with rubble. I smell explosives, and maybe flesh,” he wrote.           In a Facebook post five days ago – his most recent post on the website – Abu Toha wrote that he was “alive” and begged for an end to the bloodshed.           “Thanks for your prayers. We don’t have any access to food or clean water. Winter is coming and we don’t have enough clothes. Kids are suffering. We are suffering,” he wrote, adding, “the army is now at Al-Shifa Hospital. More death, more destruction. Who can stop this? Please stop it now.”           PEN International, the global association of writers, said Monday that it is “deeply concerned” about Abu Toha.           “We join calls demanding to know his whereabouts and the reasons for his detention,” PEN said in a statement posted to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.           The New York Review of Books also posted about his reported detention on X, noting that “in May we published his poem “What a Gazan Should Do During an Israeli Air Strike.”     This is a developing news story and will be updated.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Scientists said the ozone hole was recovering. That good news was premature, one study claims",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/climate/ozone-hole-recovery/index.html,"       The recovery of the ozone layer — which sits miles above the Earth and protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation — has been celebrated as one of the world’s greatest environmental achievements. But in a new study published Tuesday, some scientists claim it may not be recovering at all, and that the hole may even be expanding.           The findings are in disagreement with widely accepted assessments of the ozone layer’s status, including a recent UN-backed study that showed it would return to 1980s levels as soon as 2040.           In 1987, several countries agreed to ban or phase down the use of more than 100 ozone-depleting chemicals that had caused a “hole” in the layer above Antarctica. The depletion is mainly attributed to the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were common in aerosol sprays, solvents and refrigerants.           That ban, agreed under the Montreal Protocol, is widely considered to have been effective in aiding the ozone layer’s recovery.           But the hole, which grows over the Antarctic during spring before shrinking again in the summer, reached record sizes in 2020 to 2022, prompting scientists in New Zealand to investigate why.     Scientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time         In a paper, published by Nature Communications, they found that ozone levels have reduced by 26% since 2004 at the core of the hole in the Antarctic springtime.           “This means that the hole has not only remained large in area, but it has also become deeper [i.e. has less ozone] throughout most of Antarctic spring,” said Hannah Kessenich, a PhD Student at the University of Otago and lead author of the study.           “The especially long-lived ozone holes during 2020-2022 fit squarely into this picture, as the size/depth of the hole during October was particularly notable in all three years.”           To reach that conclusion, the scientists analyzed the ozone layer’s behavior from September to November using a satellite instrument. They used historical data to compare that behavior and changing ozone levels, and to measure signs of ozone recovery. They then sought to identify what was driving these changes.           They found that the depletion of ozone and deepening of the hole were a result of changes in the Antarctic polar vortex, a vast swirl of low pressure and very cold air, high above the South Pole.           The study’s authors didn’t go further to explore what was causing those changes, but they acknowledged that many factors could also contribute to ozone depletion, including planet-warming pollution; tiny, airborne particles that are emitted from wildfires and volcanoes; and changes in the solar cycle.     No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe         “Altogether, our findings reveal the recent, large ozone holes may not be caused just by CFCs,” Kessenich said. “So, while the Montreal Protocol has been indisputably successful in reducing CFCs over time and preventing environmental catastrophe, the recent persistent Antarctic ozone holes appear to be closely tied to changes in atmospheric dynamics.”           Some scientists are skeptical of the study’s findings, which rely heavily on the holes observed in 2020 to 2022 and use a short period — 19 years — to make conclusions about the long-term health of the ozone layer.           “Existing literature has already found reasons for these large ozone holes: Smoke from the 2019 bushfires and a volcanic eruption (La Soufriere), as well as a general relationship between the polar stratosphere and El Niño Southern Oscillation,” Martin Jucker, a scientist at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told the Science Media Center.           “We know that during La Niña years, the polar vortex in the stratosphere tends to be stronger and colder than usual, which means that ozone concentrations will also be lower during those years. The years 2020-22 have seen a rare triple La Niña, but this relationship is never mentioned in the study.”           He noted the study’s authors said they removed two years in the record — 2002 and 2019 — to ensure that “exceptional events” did not skew their findings.           “Those events have been shown to have strongly decreased the ozone hole size,” he said, “so including those events would probably have nullified any long-term negative trend.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Premature, sick babies receiving treatment in Egypt after Al-Shifa evacuation",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/world/gaza-al-shifa-hospital-babies-evacuated-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Twenty-eight premature babies arrived in Egypt from Gaza on Monday and are receiving care in two hospitals, an Egyptian government source said after the infants were evacuated from Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza.           The government source told CNN on Tuesday nearly all of the babies are suffering from low blood oxygen levels, while one of them is being treated for an eye injury. Several of the babies have been diagnosed with a low birth weight.           Four of the mothers traveled with their children to Egypt, but the status and whereabouts of the other parents are not known, the source said.           The babies are receiving treatment in El-Arish General Hospital in the Sinai Peninsula and in the New Administrative Capital Hospital in Cairo.           On Sunday, 31 babies were transferred from Al-Shifa to Emirati Hospital in the southern city of Rafah, in an operation mashaled by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS) and several other organizations. A CNN journalist at Rafah crossing reported the babies were greeted by hordes of medical professionals waiting with incubators to take them into care.           Two of the babies stayed at the Emirati’s ICU unit – with one infant said to be in good health – and a third baby did not transfer to Egypt as his parents are currently in northern Gaza. The other 28 were transferred to Egypt.           “We have been waiting for them during the past few days. We have made all the preparations to receive the newborn babies with all the medical equipment needed for that,” a doctor at Al-Arish, named Ahmad, told Egyptian state broadcaster Al Qahera Monday, adding some of the babies are in need of “more advanced medical measures.”           A mother of one of the premature babies transferred to a hospital in Egypt said it was the “best place on earth” for her daughter to be. She told Egyptian state run pool that after a “difficult birth” on September 28, her daughter had been placed in an incubator in Al-Shifa.           “On the seventh of October, I was supposed to go and see my daughter. She was reliant on artificial respiration. Then they asked us to leave our house, then they bombed our house. So I went to Al Shifa Hospital. It never occurred to us that the hospital would be targeted and that those children would have to go through what they went through,” Lubna El-Seik said Monday.           After Israel announced a “precise and targeted” operation in Al-Shifa and fighting began in the hospital complex, Al Seik said her daughter’s condition deteriorated. “She relied solely on artificial oxygen,” she said.           Citing doctors at the Rafah hospital, the World Health Organization said earlier the babies were fighting serious infections and 11 were in “critical condition,” due to a lack of medical supplies at Al-Shifa.           UNICEF, which worked with UN agencies and PCRS to carry out the evacuation, warned Sunday that the babies’ condition was “rapidly deteriorating.” It said the evacuation took place in “extremely dangerous conditions” and followed the “tragic death of several other babies, and total collapse of all medical services at Al-Shifa.”           Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza, has become a flashpoint in Israel’s war in the besieged enclave. The Israeli military alleges the facility is being used by Hamas as a shield for its operations and raided the hospital last Wednesday. Hamas and hospital officials have denied Israel’s claims.           For days, relentless bombardment near the hospital trapped thousands of staff, patients and civilians sheltering inside, prompting public outcry, fueled by the details of the plight of newborn babies fighting for their lives.           The WHO described Al-Shifa as a “death zone” with corridors “filled with medical and solid waste,” after a United Nations team visited the hospital for an hour on Saturday to assess the deteriorating humanitarian situation.           Palestinian authorities said several newborns have died due to power outages and a shortage of medical supplies; hospital staff described having to move babies by hand from incubators after running out of fuel and wrapping them in foil to keep them warm.         Under growing pressure to provide evidence for its claim that Hamas is using Al-Shifa for military purposes, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday released CCTV videos and still images it says show Hamas fighters bringing hostages into Al-Shifa on October 7, when Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking some 240 people into Gaza as hostages.           IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari presented two short videos, along with several still images, which he said show Hamas fighters moving the hostages – one Nepali, one Thai – through the hospital. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the videos and the stills.     What we know about what Israel has found at Al-Shifa         Dr. Ahmed Mokhallalati, the head of the hospital’s burns unit, accused Israeli forces of pushing around staff, questioning them about Hamas and restricting staff movements after the raid last week.          “The common question (staff keep being asked): Do you know anything about the Hamas groups? Do you know anything about the tunnels within the hospital?” the doctor said.           Egyptian health workers were photographed on Monday standing beside ambulances and incubators, waiting for the babies to arrive at the Rafah border, which has been used to bring in limited aid and evacuate foreign nationals.           It was hoped that the parents of the newborns would be able to travel to safety with their children, but the WHO said very few of the infants were accompanied by family members.           Gazan officials had “limited information” and were not able to find close family members, the WHO said.           One father, Ali Sbeiti, was reunited with his young son Anas, who was born three days before the war began.           “Thank God. We now feel that our son is safe after not seeing him for more than two weeks. We didn’t know whether he was dead or alive, especially when communications were disconnected with the doctors,” Sbeiti told CNN.           The intense fighting between Israel and Hamas, and a communications blackout across the enclave due to a lack of fuel, has complicated aid delivery efforts and made it more difficult for Palestinians to reach relief services.           WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday further missions were being planned to evacuate the remaining patients and staff from Al-Shifa, “pending guarantees of safe passage by parties to the conflict.”     This is a developing story and will be updated.

world,Russia adds Eurovision-winning Ukrainian singer to wanted list,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/europe/ukrainian-eurovision-winner-russia-wanted-list-intl/index.html,"       Russia has put a Ukrainian singer who won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2016 on a wanted criminal list, according to state media.           Jamala, whose full name is Susana Jamaladynova, is “on the wanted list for criminal charges,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported on Monday.           TASS cited the search database of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which reportedly said that the performer is referenced “under an article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.”           However, the database did not specify which article it was referring to, according to TASS.           Law enforcement agencies told TASS that it “may be related to the case of disseminating fake news about the Russian army.”     Sweden’s Loreen wins historic second Eurovision, after emotional show in Britain that celebrated Ukraine         The outlet also reported that Jamala was added to a list of Ukrainian artists who are banned from entering Russia for 50 years in April 2022.           In 2016, she won the hugely popular Eurovision Song Contest with a somber, controversial tune that evokes Moscow’s deportation of members of her Crimean Tatar ethnic group during World War II.           Jamala said that she wrote the song because she was inspired by a story her great-grandmother told her about the deportation of her family and others in Crimea.           The performance of the song, called “1944,” was considered a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2014 military push into Ukraine, when Russia annexed Crimea, according to European media reports.           Russian state media called it anti-Russian and Moscow said it violated Eurovision rules.           In 2022, Ukraine won Eurovision again thanks to folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra’s song “Stefania,” which was written about the frontman’s mother.     They fled Ukraine as war broke out. Now they’re throwing their homeland a party         The country surfed a wave of goodwill from European nations to clinch its third contest win, beating out competition from main rivals the United Kingdom and Spain at the competition held in the Italian city of Turin.           While the winning nation normally hosts the following year’s contest, Ukraine was unable to do so due to the Russian full-scale invasion.           The UK, the second-placed nation, stepped in, and Liverpool triumphed over bids from other British cities to stage the contest in May.           Sweden’s Loreen won the 2023 event, becoming just the second performer to win the competition more than once, clinching victory with pop ballad “Tattoo.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,Sonia Logre/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/12/europe/circus-lion-captured-loose-italy-intl/index.html,"       A lion that escaped from a circus in the Italian town of Ladispoli, near Rome, on Saturday has been recaptured after several hours on the loose, the local mayor has announced.           Just after 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, Ladispoli mayor Alessandro Grando announced on his Facebook page that the lion had been caught.           The animal had been on the loose for at least 5 hours, causing concern and confusion among local residents.           “The lion has been sedated and captured. It will now be handed over by the circus staff. I thank the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Fire Department, the local and provincial police, the Asl [Local Health Authority], and all the volunteers who served during these hours of great apprehension,” Grando said on social media on Saturday evening.           “I hope that this episode will stir some consciences, and that we can finally put an end to the exploitation of animals in circuses,” he added.           Earlier on Saturday, Grando alerted local residents immediately after the animal’s escape, urging people to stay vigilant and advising them to stay at home.           It was around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) when it was announced the lion had escaped from the circus and that the animal was immediately tracked down within the adjacent waterway.           “Circus personnel are implementing the capture operations, with the support of Law Enforcement who promptly responded to the scene. Please exercise caution and avoid movement until further notice,” the mayor said.           But the lion managed to disappear again in a very dense reedbed and reappeared in town. The lion ran away again after spotting the police car, Grando told Italian national broadcaster RAI.           When asked how the animal managed to escape from the circus, the mayor said a member of the circus’ staff saw three people running away and that they found a broken lock at the circus.           “They are talking about sabotage,” Grando said, adding that the incident will now be investigated.     How a lonely mountain lion led to the creation of the world’s largest wildlife overpass         After escaping, the lion wandered around the streets of Ladispoli, a seaside town some 50km from Rome, and was filmed by many people from their homes or cars. Several videos on social media show the lion wandering around among parked cars and in front of the gates of houses.           In order to catch the lion, veterinarians used a dart equipped with a geolocator, thanks to which the animal was eventually found and surrounded near a school, RAI reported.           According to those at the scene, the lion was in good condition, although frightened and in a state of mild hypothermia, RAI also reported.

world,Circus lion captured after hours on the loose near Rome,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/12/europe/circus-lion-captured-loose-italy-intl/index.html,"       A lion that escaped from a circus in the Italian town of Ladispoli, near Rome, on Saturday has been recaptured after several hours on the loose, the local mayor has announced.           Just after 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, Ladispoli mayor Alessandro Grando announced on his Facebook page that the lion had been caught.           The animal had been on the loose for at least 5 hours, causing concern and confusion among local residents.           “The lion has been sedated and captured. It will now be handed over by the circus staff. I thank the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Fire Department, the local and provincial police, the Asl [Local Health Authority], and all the volunteers who served during these hours of great apprehension,” Grando said on social media on Saturday evening.           “I hope that this episode will stir some consciences, and that we can finally put an end to the exploitation of animals in circuses,” he added.           Earlier on Saturday, Grando alerted local residents immediately after the animal’s escape, urging people to stay vigilant and advising them to stay at home.           It was around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) when it was announced the lion had escaped from the circus and that the animal was immediately tracked down within the adjacent waterway.           “Circus personnel are implementing the capture operations, with the support of Law Enforcement who promptly responded to the scene. Please exercise caution and avoid movement until further notice,” the mayor said.           But the lion managed to disappear again in a very dense reedbed and reappeared in town. The lion ran away again after spotting the police car, Grando told Italian national broadcaster RAI.           When asked how the animal managed to escape from the circus, the mayor said a member of the circus’ staff saw three people running away and that they found a broken lock at the circus.           “They are talking about sabotage,” Grando said, adding that the incident will now be investigated.     How a lonely mountain lion led to the creation of the world’s largest wildlife overpass         After escaping, the lion wandered around the streets of Ladispoli, a seaside town some 50km from Rome, and was filmed by many people from their homes or cars. Several videos on social media show the lion wandering around among parked cars and in front of the gates of houses.           In order to catch the lion, veterinarians used a dart equipped with a geolocator, thanks to which the animal was eventually found and surrounded near a school, RAI reported.           According to those at the scene, the lion was in good condition, although frightened and in a state of mild hypothermia, RAI also reported.           The Carabinieri are investigating the incident.           The Organization for the Protection of Animals (OIPA) said Saturday that this story “highlights the danger of circuses with animals from the point of view of public safety and, above all, the discomfort of poor creatures forced into captivity to be used for entertainment purposes,” adding that it hopes that a law banning circuses with animals will be introduced.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,‘Be prepared for all outcomes’: Inside the saga of a supervolcano that’s waking up,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/europe/supervolcano-campi-flegrei-italy-earthquake-bradyseism-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         Forget Italy’s most famous active volcano, Mt. Vesuvius, which destroyed Pompei in 79 AD.           The most dangerous volcanic threat in Italy right now is one you’ve probably never heard of: Campi Flegrei, or the Phlegraean Fields.           This unassuming plain, which stretches 200 kilometers (125 miles) under the bay of Naples and the islands of Capri and Ischia to the outskirts of the city of Naples, is a giant caldera, or depression, left by a supervolcano some 2 million years ago.           It is now the site of multiple volcanoes that have been active for 39,000 years, many of which lie underwater. It’s also populated with villas, small villages and shopping malls and home to 800,000 people and a hospital under construction. More than 500,000 of the locals live in what Italy’s civil protection agency has deemed a “red zone,” an area encompassing 18 towns that’s at highest risk in the event of an eruption. An additional 3 million residents of Naples live immediately outside the eastern edge of the caldera, according to the civil protection agency.     Second earthquake in a week hits near Naples as fears of volcanic eruption grow         The last major eruption of Campi Flegrei was in 1538, and it created a new mountain in the bay. Seismic activity in the area has been intensifying since December of 2022, according to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), and experts fear that the volcano could be reawakening after generations at rest.           The densely populated region, which is less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Vesuvius, is prone to a seismic phenomenon known as bradyseism, defined by cycles of uplift and gradual lowering of the ground. The last time the region saw such activity was 1984, when the ground rose 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) before it began a slow descent accompanied by seismic activity similar to what is happening in the area now.           Currently in a state of positive bradyseism, when the ground moves upward, the entire volcanic zone is also experiencing a surge in earthquakes that has rattled nerves and sent residents seeking safety out into the streets. In September, the strongest earthquake in 40 years struck the region, and that 4.2 magnitude quake was followed by one of a similar strength just days later.     Strange ‘earthquake lights’ explained         So far in 2023 Campi Flegrei has recorded more than 3,450 earthquakes, 1,118 of which occurred in August alone. This is more than triple the previous year’s total, according to INGV’s data. More than 500 earthquakes occurred in October, the strongest of which hit 4.0 magnitude, followed by a dozen aftershocks.           Until the beginning of May, the quakes were almost all under 3.0 magnitude, according to INGV.           Many experts think the local population should be better prepared to cope with the seismic activity and the possibility of an eruption. On October 5, the country’s civil protection agency laid out an updated evacuation plan, which calls for the movement of half a million people over a 72-hour period of time on roads many locals fear won’t accommodate such intense traffic. The last time a such a plan had been studied was in 2019, and the findings showed the evacuation plan was lacking.           Carlo Doglioni, head of the INGV, gave testimony on the potential outcomes of the seismic activity before the Italian government’s Environmental Commission’s lower chamber on September 28.           “There are two possible scenarios relating to the evolution of the situation in the Campi Flegrei: the best is that the ongoing bradyseism crisis ends as happened in 1983 to 84; the worst is an eruption similar to that of 1538,” he said.           “It is an evolution that we do not know and that we are monitoring,” Doglioni said.           Dr. Giuseppe De Natale, a research director at the INGV in Naples, said the current cycle of uplift is associated with pressure below the surface of the caldera. “We don’t know exactly the depth of the increase of pressure, it could be between zero and 3.5 kilometers,” he said.           There are two hypotheses as to what could be causing the current increase in seismic activity at Campi Flegrei, according to De Natale.           The first — and potentially most dangerous — possibility is that it could be an “intrusion of magma coming from the magma chamber located about 8 kilometers deep,” De Natale said.           The second, which he said is more likely, is that there is a large “degassing” of gases created by the magma coming from the deep magma chamber. The degassing at the same depth as the magma chamber is what he believes has caused the ground to rumble.           “The problem is the rocks,” De Natale said. “The shallow rocks cannot hold high levels of pressure, so if the pressure increases too much, there could happen complete fracturing of the rocks, which is generally the cause of the eruption of a volcano.”           Dr. Benedetto De Vivo, a retired professor of geochemistry at the University of Naples and an expert on bradyseism, agrees that the crater is degassing, and doesn’t think that the rising land is due to magma alone. These gases, he believes, are caused by the magma below the caldera receding, not rising. But he said it is impossible to know exactly what is happening.           “We can use statistics to create models, but we cannot predict the natural process because we do not know all of the variables in play,” De Vivo said.           In spite of objections by the local residents that drilling could trigger more seismic activity, De Natale won approval in 2009 to lead a team of volcano experts from 18 countries in 2012 on a mission to drill a pilot hole 501 meters (1,644 feet) deep into the caldera in an attempt to see exactly what was going on. However, Rosa Russo Iervolino, who was mayor of Naples at the time, halted the drilling project before it began, citing concerns for the population. In 2012, after she left office, the project was briefly reinstated by the new mayor, Luigi di Magistris, but by then funding had dried up and only the borehole was drilled.           De Natale said there is no plan to resume drilling and the current city government told CNN that there are areas “of greater concern” from a budgetary standpoint when it comes to city projects, including developing better evacuation plans for both Mt. Vesuvius and the Campi Flegrei area.           Supervolcanoes are among the most perplexing and least understood natural threats in the world.           What distinguishes a supervolcano from an ordinary volcano is the amount of volcanic material it has ejected during past eruptions — a reflection of the volcano’s explosive power.   Hawaii’s rumbling Kīlauea volcano produces over 320 earthquakes in 24 hours, officials say         A supervolcano is one that has ejected more than 240 cubic miles of material and reached a level 8 — the highest threat — on the Volcano Explosivity Index or VEI, according to the US Geological Survey. The VEI index measures how much debris is ejected, at what height, and for how long the eruption lasts. Yellowstone, which erupted 2.1 million years ago, was one of the largest ever known eruptions. The most recent eruptions of other notable supervolcanoes, including Long Valley in California, Toba in Indonesia, and Campi Flegrei, were all around the same size.           Scientists have a 2,000-year record of activity on Campi Flegrei. Pillars at the Roman Temple of Serapis in the city of Pozzuoli in the middle of the caldera, which were excavated in the 18th century, show evidence of holes made by molluscs, revealing the pillars were once underwater. The base of the temple is connected to the sea by a series of underground tunnels, and the rising and falling of the ground caused by bradyseism has resulted in the water flooding and then draining out of the structure, making it possible to observe the seismic phenomenon over time.           In 2016, the regional government designated the Campi Flegrei area  “yellow”  under its warning system, the second of four levels that move from green to red to indicate the danger to the population from the movement of the ground.     What you should know about the St. Elmo’s fire phenomenon — and how to stay safe         Italy’s civil protection agency said in October it would be moving some parts of the area to next level, orange, given the intensity of the recent activity. The INGV now has to sign off on the level change, which it is expected to do since it originally petitioned the civil protection agency for the move. Upping the level to orange will allow civil protection agencies to evacuate the area most vulnerable to the effects of bradyseism and the continuing earthquakes more easily and keep the most vulnerable populations safe, officials say.           During a meeting with the civil protection agency and government on November 7, the INGV also determined that 15,000 buildings, including 125 schools and other academic structures, are in the high-risk area. A directive will be released November 27 outlining a new protocol for evacuations, drills and potentially moving some institutions from the area temporarily until the current cycle of bradyseism subsides.           Parts of the volcano could be weakening due to the effects of bradyseism, according to a paper published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment in June. But the situation remains unpredictable, experts say.           “What we expect depends on whether the ground keeps rising. If it carries on moving at its current rate, we expect the number of small earthquakes per day will fluctuate over weeks from just a handful to the swarms of a few hundred events, as felt in mid-August and late September,” said study coauthor Christopher Kilburn, a professor of volcanology at University College London.           “Any larger magnitude earthquakes are most likely to occur during the swarms. These are the classic signals of crust being stretched to breaking point.”           However, this does not mean an eruption is inevitable.           “It’s the same for all volcanoes that have been quiet for generations,” said study coauthor Stefano Carlino, a volcanologist from the Vesuvius Observatory, in news release accompanying the paper.           “Campi Flegrei may settle into a new routine of gently rising and subsiding, as seen at similar volcanoes around the world, or simply return to rest,” Carlino said. “We can’t yet say for sure what will happen. The important point is to be prepared for all outcomes.”           A first step toward preparing should be avoiding population increase by prohibiting more construction in Campi Flegrei, which is one of the most developed areas in Italy, said Dr. Benedetto De Vivo, a retired professor of geochemistry at the University of Naples.           He also said there should be a better evacuation route with wider roads so that people who live in the densely populated area could evacuate within 24 hours. “We cannot construct even one more home in the area,” he said.           Italy’s volcano experts are wary about making specific predictions about volcanic eruptions for fear of being held accountable if they are wrong, according to the INGV.           Seven scientists were convicted of manslaughter for telling residents of L’Aquila in central Italy not to worry about an increase in seismic activity in 2009. An earthquake that struck a few days after one scientist had appeared to say it was OK to relax and have a glass of wine killed more than 300 people. The scientists were eventually acquitted on appeal, but the experience left the scientific community in Italy shaken.     Earth’s core is leaking, scientists say         One of the largest kinds of volcanic eruptions, called an “ignimbritic eruption” — such as the one that occurred in the Campi Flegrei area around 39,000 years ago — is not what Natale believes could happen any time soon.           “It is difficult to study these potential huge eruptions, very rare but very catastrophic, and this is one of the most important but also the most challenging areas of vulcanology,” Natale said.           He said the next Campi Flegrei eruption — if one were to occur in the near future — would most likely be more in line with the last significant activity in 1538, which created the 133-meter-tall (463-foot-tall) Monte Nuovo cone visible in the sea. However, due to population growth, the impacts of a similar event could look very different in present day.           “That (1538) was a very small eruption, that, if it would happen today, in a densely urbanized area, would be very destructive anyway,” Natale said.

world,British couple died on holiday after adjoining room fumigated for bed bugs,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/british-couple-died-bed-bugs-egypt-intl/index.html,"       A British couple died from carbon monoxide poisoning while on holiday at a luxury resort in Egypt after the room next door was sprayed with pesticide to kill bed bugs, a coroner has found.           John and Susan Cooper were staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in August 2018, when the room next to theirs was fumigated with a pesticide, ‘Lambda’, for a bug infestation, the UK’s PA Media reported. In some countries, Lambda is diluted with the substance dichloromethane, which causes the body to metabolize or ingest carbon monoxide.           The fumigated room, which was sealed with masking tape around the door, was connected to theirs with an adjoining door, according to PA.           The married couple returned to their room for the night but were found seriously ill the next day by their daughter. John Cooper, 69, was declared dead in the room, while his wife Susan, 63, died hours later in hospital.           Dr. James Adelely, senior coroner for the English county of Lancashire, ruled that the deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of inhaling the vapor from spraying the pesticide which contained dichloromethane, PA reported.           “To this day, our family struggle to comprehend what happened,” the couple’s daughter Kelly Ormerod, who was on holiday with her parents at the time, said in a statement following the inquest.           “It should have never been allowed to happen”.           She said that “nothing would make up for the pain and loss we felt since that day,” adding: “The last few years have been the most traumatic and emotional time for all of us involved.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Ukraine claims it hit two Russian landing craft in Crimea with sea drones,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/ukraine-occupied-crimea-sea-drone-attack-intl/index.html," Ukraine claimed it hit two Russian landing craft in occupied Crimea with sea drones in an overnight operation, the latest in a series of escalating  strikes on the peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.           “Two Russian assault boats have been hit with Ukrainian sea drones near Chernomorske, Crimea,” Andriy Yusov, a representative of Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR), told CNN.           GUR put out a video showing what it claims is the moment of the strikes. CNN cannot independently verify the video, date or location.           The video appears to show two sea drones approaching targets that appear to be landing craft at a dock. The second drone appears to film the first one as it hits the landing craft. As the second drone approaches its target, the video shows what looks like heavy equipment onboard.           “The boats were crewed and loaded with armored vehicles,” GUR claimed in the post on Telegram.           Russia has not officially commented on the incident.           Kyiv has ramped up assaults on occupied Crimea in recent months, in an attempt to undermine Russian forces. In September, the Ukrainian military unleashed a fierce attack on a Russian naval base in Sevastopol, in what was its most destructive strike on the port since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.           The Russian military blogger Rybar said that in the latest attack, a coordinated assault from the air diverted attention, allowing the Ukrainian sea drones to strike.     ‘We are totally ready’: Ukraine prepares for fresh Russian attacks on energy as winter nears         “The enemy struck the base of the Black Sea Fleet and the Federal Security Service in Chernomorske. They tried to hit the barracks with at least one Neptune anti-ship missile, but the missile landed nearby. Simultaneously, four unmanned boats entered Uzkaya Bay, targeting the Black Sea Fleet boats stationed there,” Rybar said.           The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces intercepted three Ukrainian drones over Crimea in the early hours on Friday. No casualties were reported.           GUR claimed Russia used similar landing craft to those destroyed on Thursday in its occupation of Zmiinyi Island, an uninhabited outpost in the Black Sea between Ukraine and occupied Crimea, at the beginning of its full-scale invasion.           Since Ukraine has ramped up attacks in the Black Sea, Russian naval air defense capabilities have been degraded and such landing craft have been serving as an alternative platform for air defense systems, according to GUR.           “In the conditions of actual lack of shipboard air defense systems after a series of attacks by the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, such boats with air defense systems on board served as cover for the invaders’ ships on the Black Sea Fleet raids,” GUR claimed.           Kyiv’s strikes on Crimea are an attempt to isolate the peninsula and make it harder for Russia to sustain its military assault on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy previously told CNN.           The Ukrainian military refocused efforts on striking Crimea after Moscow resumed its siege on Ukrainian ports following the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July, preventing crucial grain exports and threatening global food security.

world,Turmoil in UK government after key minister slams police ahead of pro-Palestinian march on Armistice Day,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/uk-sunak-pro-palestinian-march-armistice-day-intl-gbr-cmd/index.html,"       The British government is braced for a tricky weekend.           Tricky because Rishi Sunak, a prime minister whose grip on power appears to slip at every turn, is a crisis-time leader who seemingly struggles with handling crises.           On Saturday, the UK will mark Armistice Day – the date commemorating the de-facto end of World War I. Also on Saturday, pro-Palestinian protesters will march through central London demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The march will end outside the US embassy in south London.           At one point Sunak wanted to prevent this march from taking place over fears protesters would vandalize the Cenotaph, a monument in central London dedicated to the memory of those who have lost their lives in battle.           The Cenotaph is the central focus on Britain’s Remembrance Sunday, an annual event that takes place on the second Sunday in November. Every living UK Prime Minister lays a wreath at the monument, along with other senior politicians, visiting dignitaries and members of the royal family.         Needless to say, the Cenotaph is a monument that means a lot to many British people. It has been the target of vandalism from protesters of all sorts in the past, something which causes huge offense to many.           What’s this got to do with Sunak and his government?           Sunak wanted to stop the protest from happening at all. He was then forced to concede that the march would go ahead – after all, the freedom to protest is an important part of democracy. Banning such a protest in the name of those who died for precisely these sorts of freedoms is not the best look on Armistice Day.           While accepting that the march would go ahead, Sunak has stuck to his line that choosing to protest on this particular weekend is “not just disrespectful but offends our heartfelt gratitude to the memory of those who gave so much so that we may live in freedom and peace today.”           He has also taken a firm line with London’s Metropolitan Police Service, which Sunak has said will be held “accountable” should anything go wrong on Saturday.           Then Sunak’s home secretary, the controversial Conservative firebrand Suella Braverman, stepped in to up the ante.           On Thursday morning, an article written by Braverman appeared in The Times of London accusing the police of showing bias when handling protesters.           “During Covid, why was it that lockdown objectors were given no quarter by public order police yet Black Lives Matters demonstrators were enabled, allowed to break rules and even greeted with officers taking the knee,” Braverman asks.           She goes on to call the protesters who will march through London this weekend “hate marchers” and compared people marching in support of Palestinians in Gaza to those who supported Northern Irish terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s.           This all happened at a time when Sunak had spoken with the head of the Met and was trying to calm things down ahead of Saturday – even going as far as to say he had been given “reassurances that the police are taking every step necessary” to stop things getting out of control.           The leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, suggested on X (formerly known as Twitter) that “the person the PM needs to hold accountable is his home secretary. Picking a fight with the police instead of working with them is cowardice.”           The furore set off a flurry of speculation over her future in government, with national newspaper front pages dominated Friday morning by the question of whether Sunak would sack her.           Why was Braverman’s intervention so unhelpful for Sunak?           First it makes him look very weak. Downing Street has confirmed it did not sign off the column – highly unusual for a cabinet minister who is bound by the ministerial code to speak with a collective voice of government.           Is his home secretary trying to undermine him? Does she not respect his authority? Is she trying to get sacked? These are all questions being asked around Westminster. Braverman has hardly been discreet in letting her party know that she might like to lead it after Sunak.           The most common assumption is that this sort of behavior is her attempt at preparing the ground for a future leadership campaign that appeals to a right-wing Conservative base.           This is not Braverman’s first off-script act. She has spoken at fringe Conservative events about what her immigration policy might look like (hint: somewhat harder than Sunak’s).           Indeed, it isn’t even her first controversial intervention in the past seven days. She last week claimed that rough sleeping is a “lifestyle choice.” Sunak declined to repeat her comments or align himself with them.           However, he is probably too weak to sack his home secretary right now. The Conservative Party’s poll ratings are poor and Sunak is already barely holding together a fragile coalition of parliamentarians. The chaos of Brexit, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss has left the party bitterly divided and Sunak really does not want Braverman – who gives him credibility with the right of his party – fully unchained and outside his tent.           The biggest concern for Sunak long-term is how this exposes the extent to which any issues can be politicized and how much appetite there is to politicize these issues among his own team.           And the fact he is now openly taking hits from both the opposition and from within his own party all does nothing to help the fact that his Conservative Party, after nearly 14 years in power, is struggling to look like it has a vision - or even hope - for the future.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"20,000 trucks stuck at Ukraine-Poland border amid spat over access to EU",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/poland-ukraine-border-truck-protest-intl/index.html,"       More than 20,000 trucks from Poland and Ukraine are blocked at three major border crossings as striking Polish drivers protest an EU deal that allows Ukrainian trucks unlimited access to the bloc.           On Monday, Polish carriers began blocking the movement of trucks along the three largest border crossing points between the two countries: Korczowa-Krakowiec, Hrebenne-Rava-Ruska and Dorohusk-Yahodyn, Ukrainian state media Ukrinform reported.           “Currently, more than 20,000 vehicles are blocked on both sides. The economy of not only Ukraine or Poland suffers losses, but also of other countries that cannot transport goods,” Ukraine’s Ministry of Restoration said in a statement Thursday.           Truck drivers from Ukraine have been exempt from seeking permits to cross the Polish border since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Polish drivers claim that Russian and Belarusian entities have been setting up Polish outfits, according to Reuters.           The strikes follow a spat between the neighboring countries earlier this year over cheap Ukrainian grain, which would normally be shipped from the country’s now-occupied Black Sea ports, but instead flowed into Europe through Poland.     Russia parades Ukrainian war prisoners as ‘volunteers’ for its army in apparent violation of international law         The influx of product undercut Polish farmers, leading to a now-lapsed temporary EU ban. Poland does not allow Ukrainian grain to be sold in its domestic market.           Poland’s support has been essential to Ukraine’s war effort; since February 2022, several million displaced people left Ukraine and into Poland, and several billions’ worth of NATO military equipment has been rushed in through Polish territory.           But fatigue is setting in in Poland and sympathy waning – as was apparent during the country’s recent election campaign, in which right-wing parties sought to capitalize on anti-Ukrainian sentiment.           The International Transport Association of Ukraine said that Poles “are not satisfied with the high competition that developed after the liberalization of international transportation between Ukraine and the EU countries.” Therefore, one of the demands is the cancellation of visa-free transport, Ukrinform noted.           Serhii Derkach, a deputy minister at Ukraine’s Infrastructure Ministry, told Ukrinform that this demand is “impossible to fulfill.”           “It is impossible to cancel the agreement on the liberalization of transportation, because it is a matter of bilateral agreements between the EU and Ukraine. And Poland cannot do anything unilaterally,” he said.           On Monday, Ukraine’s Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Zvarych called the protests “a knife in the back” of Ukraine, which has seen transportation routes, including airspace and ports, severely limited since the invasion began.           According to the Ukrainian national broadcaster Suspilne, the organizers of the protest said they plan to let one truck per hour to go through the border.           The protesters do not plan to obstruct the movement of the trucks that are transporting humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Suspilne noted, adding that the protesters also said they have permission to hold a picket until January 3.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Rebecca Wright/CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/middleeast/israel-survivors-eilat-threat-intl-cmd/index.html,"       As a red alert alarm sounded in the busy hotel dining hall, many of the children scattered in fear, as the horrors of the Hamas massacre on October 7 came flooding back.           Thousands of families who survived the attacks on the Israeli collective communities known as kibbutzim are now homeless and sheltering in hotels along the beaches of the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. But even now, they face a new threat from a different militant group, the Iran-backed Houthis.           “Everyone thought that Eilat, southern tip of Israel, would be safe from attacks,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, 60, a resident of the Nir Oz kibbutz. “We have had to endure several alerts and some impacts from missiles and attack drones coming from the Houthis in Yemen.”           In recent weeks, the Houthis have claimed several missile and drone attacks against Israel and warned further strikes would come. Israeli jets and its Arrow defense system have been deployed to counter missiles and other “aerial threats” in the Red Sea area.     Video shows dozens of bodies after alleged attack at UN-run school in Gaza         One alarm sounded in Eilat on November 9 when a suicide drone landed on a school a few miles from the hotel, although thankfully there were no children in the building at the time. While the Houthis claimed responsibility for that attack, Israel later said the drone had come from Syria and struck a site there in response.           “It’s been absolutely awful,” said Dekel-Chen of the repeated alerts. “All of the kids from a very young age, up to and including teenagers, (you) could see the absolute terror in their eyes, because it just transported them back to that absolute visceral fear of death that they experienced.”           As they face this continued threat, the displaced residents are also burying their dead, and campaigning to have their loved ones released from captivity in Gaza.           Dekel-Chen’s 35-year-old son Sagui disappeared on October 7, and the family believes he was kidnapped by Hamas.           “It’s excruciating,” Dekel-Chen said. “We don’t know if he’s healthy, or wounded. We know nothing… Hope is hard to come by right now.”           Dekel-Chen is now helping to care for his two granddaughters and his pregnant daughter-in-law, who is due to have a third child within the next few weeks.           Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and it has been pounding Gaza with missiles from the air, land and sea, along with a ground offensive which began in late October. Israel says it is targeting the Hamas leadership and network of subterranean tunnels, but the impact on the Palestinian civilian population has been catastrophic, with more than 12,000 killed and at least 30,000 injured and many hospitals unable to function due to a fuel blockade.           The worsening humanitarian disaster has caused a global outcry and calls for a pause in fighting, but Israel has insisted that there will be “no ceasefire” without the release of the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas.           In Eilat, around 160 survivors from Nir Oz are now living in the Isrotel Yam Suf, a hotel which overlooks the beach and the rust-colored mountains of Jordan just a few miles across the narrow Gulf of Aqaba.           But the beauty and tranquillity of this location is shattered by the tales of terror from those living inside. More than a quarter of the community of 400 people in Nir Oz were either killed or kidnapped, residents say, making it one of the worst affected kibbutzim.           And 12-year-old Uri Barr doesn’t have enough fingers to count the number of his friends who were taken.           “Wow, there is a lot,” Uri said, eyes widening, as he worked out that his family knows at least 20 people who were kidnapped, 12 of them children.           Uri and his youngest brother, 8-year-old Noam, and their parents all barricaded themselves into the safe room of their house for six hours in silence, as hundreds of Hamas militants went from house to house, murdering the residents and burning their houses.           “(Dad said) Hamas is in the house, be quiet,” Uri told CNN, sitting alongside his father Yonathan. “I heard them screaming in Arabic.”           “We heard them breaking into our house and smashing it up, trying to open our safety room door,” Yonathan said. “They were shooting at houses. RPG on houses, grenades on civilians.”           The Barr family were lucky to have a safe room which locked from the inside. Most of the residents didn’t, as the shelters were designed for protection from Hamas rockets.           Uri’s main concern during those long hours trapped in the room was for his other little brother, 10-year-old Yoav, who had been at a friend’s house on a sleepover the night before.           “It was terrible,” Yonathan said. “(Uri) was crying in the safe room because of that.”           The family with whom Yoav was staying also survived in their safe room, and the Barrs were reunited later that day, after the Israeli military arrived.           “I collapsed, I broke down that moment,” Yonathan said. “(Uri) said it was the first time he saw me cry.”           Now Uri’s main worry is for his close friend Eitan, who was taken hostage by Hamas.           “He is a very good friend and we (were) playing soccer in the kibbutz,” Uri said, adding that he plans to “hug him” if he escapes from captivity.           Uri tries to take his mind off his missing friends by taking part in sports and playing in the water. He’s old enough to be accustomed to hearing the missile alerts, but said some of the younger children panic when they hear the warnings.           Nir Adar, a 35-year-old from Nir Oz, said he tries to stay relaxed when the alarms go off, in the hope that his two young daughters understand that they are safe.           “They see all the people around running and afraid, so this is what’s really affecting them,” Adar said.           Adar and his daughters, 6-year-old Noga and 4-year-old Rani, survived October 7 by hiding in their safe room. The door did not have a lock, so he pulled the handle shut with all of his strength, he said.           “The terrorists came to my house, breaking the door and shooting around 10 bullets at the door of the safe room, which at the same time I was holding,” Adar said, adding that the bullets luckily did not penetrate the door.           The community’s WhatsApp group chain from that day, now posted online, shows the abject terror the residents were experiencing, minute-by-minute.           As Adar sent panicked messages and watched his phone battery drain down, he told his daughters fairy tales and pretended that a tree had fallen on the house to explain why they were trapped.           “(My daughter) asked me if this is soldiers in our house, so I said yeah, this is soldiers and they (are) keeping us safe,” he said. “I tried to create them an alternative reality.”           When they finally emerged from his home in the late afternoon, Adar realized that his brother’s house – just 20 meters away – had been set ablaze.           His brother, 38-year-old Tamir, was kidnapped by Hamas, while his wife and children escaped capture. But Adar fears that even if Tamir has survived to this point, he’ll now never get out.           “I’m afraid that the men will stay left behind,” he said, partly because the negotiations for hostage release are currently focused on women and children.           Adar said his brother’s children are struggling to cope without their dad. “It’s very hard for them, especially at night,” Adar said. “They’re crying a lot there. They miss him.”           The members of the Nir Oz community in Eilat came together to sing in the hotel lounge recently, with the surviving children holding posters of their loved ones. Video of the event seen by CNN showed a little girl breaking down in tears as she held a photo of her father as high as her arms could reach.           Adar has also learned that his 85-year-old grandmother was kidnapped by Hamas. “She’s sick, she needs medicines,” Adar said. “I’m not sure if she will be able to survive.           Before October 7, Nir Oz was “a kind of garden of Eden in the middle of the desert, thriving community, multigenerational, and what’s left after the Hamas attack is a smoking hole,” Dekel-Chen said.           The kibbutz is now largely deserted, apart from a handful of locals who have been managing the site by retrieving valuables and possessions, boarding up houses, and ensuring that damaged water pipes and electricity cables are made safe.           Along with up to 200 Hamas attackers who flooded Nir Oz, there were also dozens of unarmed men who looted properties during the six-hour ordeal. Security camera footage that the kibbutz management shared with CNN shows dozens of young men taking away bicycles, often cycling on one and holding another bike to maximize how much they could steal.           As anger grows among Israelis about the failures of their government, Connecticut-born Dekel-Chen flew to the United States last week, to attend a march in the capital and meet with White House officials, including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, to advocate on behalf of the families of the hostages.           “As a country (this) will take us generations to really work through, not just because of the monumental failures of our government and army as well on that day, but just the ripple effects of the damage done,” Dekel-Chen said.           “We were abandoned at our moment of need.”           The Nir Oz residents have been told by the government that it will take three years before the kibbutz is rebuilt and ready for their return. But healing the scars from that day will take much longer, and many of the families told CNN they would never go back.     Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu battles on all fronts, amid growing pressure to free hostages         “I don’t think we can go back to Nir Oz because what we’ve been through is horror,” Yonathan Barr said. “All the security and safety that we felt in our home is gone. And I won’t do it again to my children.”           “The country should protect the civilians and if they can’t do it, (the) deal is broken between the citizens and the state,” Adar said. “How can you live here if you’re not safe?”           As they work out their next steps, the families hope that staying together as a community in Eilat will help the grieving process.           “Children are resilient, if surrounded by love,” Dekel-Chen said. “(But) most of them are terrified to be more than a meter or two from their parents,” he added, and they are “incredibly fearful of any sound that isn’t normal, or any person that they don’t know.”           The families are receiving psychological therapy and the children are attending a kids’ club, but they haven’t been in school for a month – and their uncertain future is unsettling the whole community.           The key focus for the families now is to grieve their loved ones, and to bring back the hostages.           “The main idea is that we want our people to come back,” Yonathan said. “It’s like we need them, (for) us to be whole again.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,What we know about what Israel says it has found at Al-Shifa,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/middleeast/israel-al-shifa-gaza-what-we-know-intl/index.html,"       Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a flashpoint in Israel’s war against Hamas, which began when gunmen from the militant group crossed the border into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people.           Palestinians and humanitarian agencies say the current fighting in and around Al-Shifa is proof of Israel’s wanton disregard for civilian life in Gaza, while Israel accuses Hamas of using the medical center as a shield for its operations. On top of providing medical care, the Al-Shifa Hospital had recently become a key shelter for thousands of Palestinian civilians fleeing Israeli bombardment.           Since launching its operation at the hospital on November 15, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have shown images of a tunnel shaft and military equipment, but have yet to show conclusive proof of the large-scale command and control center it alleges is there.           Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry and hospital officials have denied Israel’s claims, saying that hospitals in the Strip have only been used to treat patients. Doctors in Al-Shifa have also sounded the alarm about deteriorating conditions inside the medical facility, which is struggling to meet patients’ needs amid supply shortages and the presence of Israeli troops.           The IDF is now under pressure to prove Israel’s long-standing assertion with its promise of “concrete evidence.” Its ability to continue its operation in Gaza, and the credibility of Israel, could be at stake as the number killed in Gaza surpasses 12,000, according to authorities in the Hamas-controlled Strip.           Here’s what we know so far.           For weeks, the IDF said Hamas has been using Gaza’s largest hospital as cover for what it calls terror infrastructure below ground. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Hamas had a command and control center or headquarters underneath the hospital complex grounds, which other senior Israeli officials have also insisted on.           In a presentation to the media last month, Hagari claimed that Hamas was directing rocket attacks and commanding operations from bunkers underneath the hospital building, which he said were linked to a network of tunnels that Hamas had dug underneath Gaza City.           The IDF also published an “intelligence-based” illustrated video of what it claims the Hamas headquarters under Al-Shifa looks like. The video shows a 3D diagram of the hospital, which moves to show an animated network of purported tunnels and operation rooms.           CNN cannot independently verify Israel’s claims that Hamas is operating a “command and control center” from the hospital.           The White House has backed Israel’s claims, saying that Hamas was storing weapons and operating a command node from Al-Shifa, citing US intelligence. But senior US officials have declined multiple times to expand on how they can corroborate Israel’s claims, as the US does not have a presence on the ground in Gaza.           Over the weekend, the IDF took CNN and other news organizations to a newly exposed tunnel shaft on the grounds of the Al-Shifa hospital complex that it says was used by Hamas.           The structure appeared to be substantial, with the remains of a ladder hanging over the opening and a pole that looked like a hub for a spiral staircase running through the middle of the shaft.           The IDF also released video – filmed on Friday – from inside the shaft, showing a staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel that the military said was 55 meters long and located 10 meters underground. At the end of the tunnel is a metal door with a small window, according to the video, which the IDF said it had not yet opened to the possibility that Hamas had booby-trapped it.           The video is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not, however, establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Al-Shifa.           The Israeli military on Sunday also presented several videos that it said illustrated Hamas’ presence at Al-Shifa hospital, including CCTV footage that appeared to show hostages being brought through the hospital itself and separate footage from inside a tunnel shaft on the medical compound’s grounds. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the videos.           The CCTV footage showed Hamas fighters moving a Nepalese hostage and a Thai hostage through the hospital on October 7, IDF spokesperson Hagari said. One appears to be frog-marched through the building, while another appears to be bleeding and is pushed on a gurney.           Hagari did not spell out how the IDF had acquired the videos, though he did say that Israeli intelligence officers were part of the operation inside the hospital to try to locate the hostages.           Hagari also dismissed suggestions that the hostages had been brought to the hospital because they were wounded, claiming that one of the two hostages in the videos was not injured and did not need medical treatment. They had been brought to the hospital first before being moved to hiding spots like nearby apartments, he said.           The shared CCTV footage comes after Israel’s military said it found the bodies of two Israeli hostages – a 65-year-old woman and an Israeli soldier – in the same neighborhood as Al-Shifa hospital.     Why Gaza’s largest hospital has become the ‘epicenter’ of Israel’s war on Hamas         The IDF had previously touted other alleged discoveries on the hospital grounds, saying soldiers located a room in Al-Shifa where they found “technological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by Hamas” for “terrorist purposes.”           Hamas has rejected those claims as “baseless lies.”           CNN analysis of separate footage published online by the IDF prior to visits from international media outlets suggests weaponry at Al-Shifa may have been rearranged.           An IDF video on November 15 showed a military spokesperson touring the facility, during which an AK-47 gun is seen behind an MRI machine. Fox News and the BBC were subsequently granted access to the hospital. In their reports filmed after the IDF clip, two AK-47 guns are visible in the same location. It is unclear where the second assault rifle came from.           The IDF told CNN the discrepancy between the military’s own video and the BBC footage was “due to the fact that more weaponry and terrorist assets were discovered throughout the day.”           “Suggestions that the IDF is manipulating the media are incorrect,” it said.           The United Nations has called for access to the site for an independent investigation into the competing allegations and warned that hospitals should not be used as battlegrounds for any side.           Israel’s allegations have been vehemently denied by Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry, and hospital officials.           The director general of the Hamas-controlled health ministry, Dr. Medhat Abbas, told CNN that hospitals in the enclave “are used to treat patients only” and are not being used “to hide anyone.”           The health ministry responded to the images of hostages inside Al-Shifa released Sunday by the IDF by questioning their authenticity – but went on to say that if true, the pictures showed that hospitals in Gaza provided medical care to anyone who needed it.           In a statement issued Saturday before the release of the CCTV videos, Hamas said it had brought several hostages to hospitals for medical treatment after they were injured in Israeli air strikes.           After Israel launched its operation, Hamas accused the US of giving Israel “a green light … to commit more massacres against civilians” by amplifying what it called a “false narrative” that a militant command center lies somewhere inside Al-Shifa.           More than five days since the IDF raided Al-Shifa hospital, Israeli troops are still on hospital grounds, and the facility is still filled with patients and medical staff operating in dire humanitarian circumstances.           Doctors who are still at the hospital cannot treat patients due to heavy shelling in the past week. Fuel shortages and a lack of electricity prevent them running incubators for the babies. ICU patients and several neonatal babies in Al-Shifa have died in recent days.     A doctor inside Al-Shifa hospital told CNN Monday that staff movements around the complex were being restricted, and Israeli forces are questioning staff about Hamas and tunnels.     ‘Where will I leave these children, on the street?’ The struggle for survival faced by disabled Palestinians in Gaza         Dr. Ahmed El Mokhallalati, head of the burns unit, said the hospital is also running out of urgent requirements, including anesthetics, oxygen tanks, medicine and blood banks.           Israel’s Defense Ministry says it delivered more than 6,000 liters of water and 2,300 kg of food — including fish, canned food, bread, spreads and dates — over the weekend.           El Mokhallalati also told CNN that Israeli forces had removed about 200 bodies from the hospital’s mortuary as well as from mass graves recently dug on the site. “They brought two trucks and they have taken all the dead bodies out of the hospital,” he said.           Several days ago, Israel’s army spokesman Hagari dodged a question about whether Israel had taken bodies out of the hospital complex as part of its efforts to determine the fate of hostages kidnapped from communities in southern Israel on October 7.           A group of UN humanitarian workers visited Al-Shifa on Saturday, describing the hospital as a “death zone” where “signs of shelling and gunfire” were evident.           An Egyptian government official told CNN Monday that 28 of 31 premature babies that were evacuated from Al-Shifa to southern Gaza have arrived in Egypt through the Rafah crossing. The three remaining babies remained in Gaza but are still alive, the official added.           The sprawling medical facility of Al-Shifa, which sits in the western part of Gaza City, was built in 1946 when Gaza was still under British rule.           It has long been seen as the backbone of medical services across the besieged Gaza Strip, and Israel’s operations there have compounded a grim humanitarian crisis, Palestinian health officials have said.

world,CNN visited the exposed tunnel shaft in the Al-Shifa hospital compound. Here’s what we saw,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-shaft-al-shifa-hospital-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Even in the darkness, the utter devastation in northern Gaza is clear as day. The empty shells of buildings, illuminated by the last shreds of light, lurch out of the landscape on the dirt roads across the Gaza Strip. At night, the only signs of life are the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles that rumble the landscape, tightening the military’s grip on the northern sector.           On Saturday night, we traveled with the IDF into Gaza to see the newly exposed tunnel shaft discovered at the compound of Al-Shifa Hospital, the enclave’s largest medical facility.           After crossing the border fence at around 9:00 in the evening, our convoy of Humvees turned off its lights, relying on night vision goggles to traverse the Gaza Strip. We would spend the next six hours inside Gaza, much of that time spent getting back and forth from the tunnel shaft.           Along our path, virtually every building bore the scars of wartime damage. Many structures were destroyed entirely, while others were hardly recognizable as anything more than twisted metal. If there was life here, it had long since departed. Residents had either moved south or been killed during six weeks of war.           Our first stop was a location on the beach where the IDF had set up a staging area. From there, we moved into armored personnel carriers with several other reporters for the last kilometer to the hospital. The only view outside came through a night-vision screen. But even in black and white, the level of destruction was shocking.           Inside Gaza City, the skeletal remains of apartment towers and high-rise buildings packed the otherwise vacant city streets. Even if we could speak to Palestinians while embedded with the IDF, there was no one around to talk to.           CNN reported from inside Gaza under IDF media escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join this embed, media outlets had to submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review and agreed not to reveal sensitive locations and soldiers’ identities. CNN retained editorial control over the final report.           As we stepped out of the armored vehicle, we were enveloped by utter darkness. We were only allowed to use our red lights to navigate to a nearby building, where we waited until Israeli forces already on the ground secured the area. The tunnel shaft was very close by, but it was entirely exposed.           The commander in charge of our group, Lt. Col. Tom said this tunnel is significantly larger than others he had seen before. “This is a big tunnel,” he said. “I have encountered tunnels — in 2014 in [Operation] Protective Edge, I was a company commander — and this tunnel is an order of magnitude bigger than a standard tunnel.”           We had expected to hear fighting once we entered Gaza City itself. Instead, we heard almost complete silence. Only once during our roughly 45 minutes at the hospital did we hear the distant sound of small arms fire, and it was impossible to tell how far away it was in the midst of an urban environment. The rest of the time, the silence made the darkness feel even more oppressive.           It was nearing midnight as we walked the last few feet to the exposed tunnel shaft. The IDF had promised “concrete evidence” that Hamas was using the hospital complex above ground as cover for what it called terror infrastructure underneath, including a command and control hub.           Several days earlier, the IDF had released what it said was the first batch of evidence, which included weapons and ammunition they said they found inside the hospital itself. But the pictures were a far cry from proving that Hamas had a facility underneath, and a CNN investigation found that some of the guns had been moved around.           The discovery of the tunnel shaft the next day was more compelling, showing an entrance to something underground. But even then, it was unclear what it was or how far down it went. This is what everyone has been trying to understand.           Standing on the edge of the tunnel shaft, it was apparent that the structure itself was substantial. At the top, the remains of a ladder hung over the lip of the opening. In the center of the round shaft, a center pole looked like a hub for a spiral staircase. The shaft itself extended down farther than we could see, especially in the meager light of our headlamps.           Video released by the IDF from inside the shaft showed what we could not see from the top of the opening. The video shows a spiral staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel. The IDF said the tunnel shaft extends downwards approximately 10 meters and the tunnel runs for 55 meters. At its end stands a metal door with a small window.           “We need to demolish the underground facility that we found,” said IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. “I think the leadership of Hamas is in great pressure because we found this facility, and we are now going to demolish it. It’s going to take us time. We’re going to do it safely, but we’re going to do it.”           It is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Gaza’s largest hospital, but it is clear that there is a tunnel down below. Seeing what connects to that tunnel is absolutely critical.     IDF claims video shows hostages in Al-Shifa hospital         For Israel, the stakes could not be higher. Israel has publicly asserted for weeks, if not years, that Hamas has built terror infrastructure below the hospital. The ability to continue to prosecute the war in the face of mounting international criticism depends to a large extent on Israel being able to prove this point.           Hamas has repeatedly denied that there is a network of tunnels below Shifa hospital. Health officials who have spoken with CNN have said the same, insisting it is only a medical facility.           As is so rarely the case in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this answer truly is black and white. Either there is an underground series of tunnels below the hospital. Or there is not.     Clarification: The headline on this story has been updated to reflect that the tunnel shaft was discovered on the grounds of the Al-Shifa hospital complex.   © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,"One evacuated from northern Gaza, the other didn’t. They’re in the same hospital now",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/middleeast/gaza-refugees-cairo-hospital-intl-cmd/index.html,"       When Rami Mahmoud left his family’s home to buy food, his wife, Elham Maged, stayed behind to pray. When he made his way back through the narrow, tightly packed nearby streets of northern Gaza’s Jabalya Refugee Camp﻿, he returned to a scene of complete chaos. An Israeli airstrike had smashed into the center of the densely populated community, tearing a deep crater into its heart. Their apartment had vanished.           Scanning the devastation, Mahmoud suddenly noticed a single finger reaching up between the rubble; it was Elham. Miraculously she had survived. But his relief at finding her alive was brief. Two of their children, they would soon discover, were dead.  Nothing would ever be the same again.           Two weeks on from the horror of that day, the couple are more than 200 miles southwest of Gaza City, inside Cairo’s Nasser Medical Institute in neighboring Egypt. The wreckage and chaos of their shattered home was replaced by the cleanliness and order of this foreign medical facility, the noise of rockets and explosions exchanged for the benign, insistent hum of traffic crawling through Egypt’s bustling capital.           But safety and care does not bring comfort; they are still haunted by grief. “My daughter, just an hour before she died, she called her best friend and said, ‘I feel like something is going to happen to me. Can you take care of my mother and visit her often?’” Elham told us.           “My son is a handsome boy, he was in high school, he used to go to the gym and lift weights, and he is tall and well built,” she continued, tears streaming down her face. “He liked to look good. He got a haircut two days before he was killed, in the middle of war. He said, ‘even if I die, I want to die looking good.’”           Mahmoud shared family photos with us.  Their daughter, just 15, her wide, clear eyes and delicate features framed by a headscarf; their son, 17, carrying a small boy on his back, a warm smile shining from beneath his tousled black hair.           “God created them, God took them,” his wife said. “I just want to go back to the rest of my children. There is no internet there, so I don’t know anything about them. I know they are with their grandfather somewhere safe, hopefully, but we have no way of reaching them.”           Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 12,000 Palestinians since October 7, including an estimated 5,000 children, according to the Hamas government press office. Israel says its airstrikes intend to target Hamas commanders and infrastructure, following the militant group’s October 7 terror attacks, which left 1,200 people dead in Israel and saw about 240 taken hostage.           The Israeli military has focused its ground operations in northern Gaza – where Rami and Elham lived – and where it claims to have now seized control. Gaza civilians in the north have been ordered to evacuate southward, but airstrikes do not spare that part of the densely-inhabited enclave, either.           Muhammed Wadea blames himself for following the Israeli evacuation orders, telling CNN that he made the decision to heed the IDF’s warnings and move his family out of their home to head south.           On October 16, he and his young children found themselves in the southern city of Khan Younis, where another apparent Israeli strike tore into the building in which they were sheltering.           Today Wadea’s 9-year-old son, Abdelrahman, shares a hospital room at Nasser Medical Institute with his 14-year-old sister. Both children sustained multiple injuries in the strike – broken bones, skin torn from their bodies, shrapnel lodged in flesh.           Abdelrahman recalled that one moment he was sitting on a sofa eating potato chips with his cousin, the next he awoke beneath rubble and surrounded by carnage.           There was no warning, nor was there any sign of Hamas where they were staying, Wadea said, standing restlessly by his children, pain etched on his face as he wrestled with heartbreaking guilt. He began to weep as he spoke.           “I hope that Abdelrahman’s siblings are fine and alive,” he said. “May God have mercy on them. I have nine children. My eldest, Riham is 18, she is married. My youngest is 4 years old.”          Both Wadea and Mahmoud’s families left Gaza through Rafah Crossing, the only way out of the Palestinian enclave since Israel sealed other exits after the October 7 attack.           A limited number of injured Palestinians and foreign nationals have been allowed to flee Gaza into Egypt through Rafah, following a deal brokered by Qatar between Israel, Hamas, and Egypt, in coordination with the United States.           Nasser Medical Institute is one of 37 hospitals that have been readied to accept injured evacuees from Gaza, Egypt’s health minister, Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, told CNN.           More than 1,100 beds, 1,700 ICU units, as well as facilities such as incubators, have been set aside, he explained. As of this week more than 200 places have been filled, but the trickle of those able to cross the border since November 1 remains slow.           On Friday, more than 550 foreign nationals and 45 injured Palestinians, along with 40 companions, left Gaza through the crossing, an Egyptian border official told a journalist working with CNN in Rafah.           Among those making the treacherous journey is one particularly vulnerable group. Last week, Egyptian officials were expecting three dozen newborn infants to be evacuated to Egypt after being born into the harshest of environments at Al-Shifa hospital.           At Al-Shifa hospital, the IDF’s controversial operation to uncover what both Israeli and US intelligence insist is a Hamas command and control center has seen electricity dwindle to exhaustion – and with it the critical ability to pump oxygen into incubators, vital to the survival of these helpless newborns.           Thirty-one babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa hospital on Sunday to the southern Gazan city of Rafah; Palestinian authorities said several newborns had died due to power outages and a shortage of medical supplies.           On Monday, 28 babies arrived in Egypt from Gaza at the Rafah crossing, according to an Egyptian government official. One baby was discharged in Gaza and went home with his parents to their temporary shelter, while two others stayed in the ICU unit of the Emirati hospital in Rafah, Gaza.           Israel’s siege of Gaza has included a near-total blockade of food, water and electricity, with exceptions for what the United Nations has called a “trickle” of humanitarian aid. Conditions in Gaza have grown desperate as fuel supplies dwindle, forcing the closure of 26 of the enclave’s 35 hospitals.           Ghaffar told CNN last week that Egypt was poised to receive these tiny, delicate souls headed on the fraught route to the Rafah border crossing, but as the clock ticked, the atmosphere was growing ever more tense. “Time is important,” he said. “Every single minute that we’re not getting them in… the chance of losing their life is very high.”           The subtext was clear; in these bleakest, darkest of hours, some tragedies are playing out beyond the reach of those who might be able to avert them.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,‘Never going back:’ Israelis evacuated from border town with Lebanon fear war with Hezbollah,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-tiberias-evacuation-intl/index.html,"       It should be the height of tourist season in Tiberias, an Israeli city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee where the New Testament says many of Jesus’ miracles were performed.           But instead of pilgrims, thousands of Israelis evacuated from communities close to the Lebanese border have arrived in Tiberias, swelling the city’s population by 20% Mayor Boaz Yosef told CNN. He described the evacuation as “the biggest” movement of Israelis in decades.           In the weeks since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, a low intensity conflict has been raging in the north of the country as crossfire between Israel and Lebanon-based militants becomes increasingly deadly. A Reuters journalist is among the civilians to have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border, and last Sunday an employee of an Israeli electric supplier was killed in a strike by an anti-tank missile in the Israeli border town of Dovev.           Like its south, Israel’s northern border area has been emptying, after the Defense Ministry ordered the mandatory evacuation of more than 40 communities there in October. There are fears of a full-blown confrontation with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon – that would open up a dangerous new front in the war.           Several of Dovev’s evacuees, who have been living in Tiberias for a month, told CNN that they may never be ready to return to their moshav (cooperative community).           Dovev residents point to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who has repeatedly evoked a hypothetical scenario in which his fighters would conduct an incursion into northern Israel in case war erupted between Lebanon and Israel again.           Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The Iran-backed Islamist movement, which has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border, has participated in several conflicts in the Middle East, including in Iraq and Syria. Border skirmishes between Israel and the group have escalated in the past two weeks with the cross-fire intensifying in frequency and depth of territory in the border region.           From the basement of a hotel in Tiberias, where dozens of evacuated children were attending a makeshift lesson, Elana Pilveny told CNN that there was “no way in hell I am going back.” Her family is not taking any chances with Hamas’ ally in southern Lebanon after October 7, when Hamas massacred 1,200 people, many of whom were civilians.           A quiet knitting circle in the hotel lobby, consisting of four cousins who have lived in Dovev for decades, belies the panic among the evacuees. “I don’t know how to function normally if I have to go back to Dovev,” Shoshana Yakut, 77, told CNN from a hotel in Tiberias where she has lived for over a month.           They have lived through the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and fight with Hezbollah in 2006. “We never felt something so powerful,” she said of the October 7 attacks. “Not in 67, not in 73, or not in 82 and 2006 – this is a whole new level of fear right now.”           Pilveny owns a small poultry farm in Dovev with her husband and said the electric company’s worker who died last week was there to restore a powerline to the community’s chicken farms. Her husband has since asked Israel’s agricultural ministry to humanely slaughter their chickens, she said.           From his office, looking over the azure Sea of Galilee, Tiberias mayor Yosef said more than 10,000 people have been evacuated to his city, filling up 35 hotels in the town – which is 30 kilometers south of the border.     Clashes at Lebanon-Israel border raise fears of wider war         He says residents have “embraced” the newcomers but the war has hurt the local tourism industry: Restaurants stand empty and boat tours are few and far between.           The international community has been attempting to avert a wider regional war. But Yosef said he believes that to ensure the safety of Israel “we must make war in Lebanon” in order to dismantle Hezbollah’s capabilities, citing the dangers of the group’s estimated arsenal of 150,000 rockets and precision-guided munitions.           “If not, what happened in the south (of Israel) will happen in the north,” he said, adding this was the view of other mayors in northern Israel.           Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a warning to Hezbollah following a day of cross-border exchanges, saying: “What we’re doing in Gaza can also be done in Beirut. We didn’t use even 10% of the Air Force’s capabilities in Gaza.”           At another hotel in Tiberias, 75-year-old veteran David Shenfer, who was evacuated from the town of Kiryat Shmona near the northern tip of Israel, said that while he cannot wait to return home but worries about the violence with Hezbollah.           The ideal situation is a “political solution” where Hezbollah withdraws behind Lebanon’s Litani River, he said, citing a 2006 United Nations’ resolution that called for Hezbollah to not operate between the Israeli-Lebanese border and the river 13 miles (20km) to its north.           Hezbollah continues to operate south of the river and Israel has routinely violated the resolution with territorial breaches through overflights in Lebanon.           Absent a political agreement “they are going to have to force Hezbollah to go north,” Shenfer said.           The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War saw an attempt to create a buffer zone in that area, but the conflict ended with no clear victor or vanquished. Many parts of Lebanon were devastated, but Hezbollah foiled Israel’s ultimate plan to dismantle the group.           The overwhelming worry among the evacuated is when they can make it home, or whether they will at all, and if not, what will be next? The spokesperson for Kibbutz Bar’am, one of 30 kibbutzim in the country that have stuck to a socialist model, said her main concern is what the war will do to their community model.           “We’ve lost a lot of certainty we had before,” Lea Raivitz said. Residents in her kibbutz put forward their entire net salary to the community and receive a monthly budget in return. As a result, “we don’t pay for the houses. We don’t pay for the electricity. We don’t pay for the water, health, healthcare, education,” she said.           After spending a month in a hotel, there is a fear some kibbutz members will move away. While she is determined to return to her hillside community, the prospect currently seems impossible, Raivitz said, explaining that Hezbollah militants have hoisted flags near a border fence close to the kibbutz. “It’s our home, we’re waiting for that moment (to return), but it’s difficult to even imagine.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Five countries ask International Criminal Court to investigate the situation in Palestinian territories,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-crimes-icc-referral/index.html,"       The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor Karim Khan says his office has received a referral from five countries to investigate whether crimes have been committed in the Palestinian territories as part of Israel’s response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks.           South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti submitted the referral, Khan said.           “In accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, a State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of such crimes,” Khan said in a statement.           He noted that his office was already conducting an investigation on the situation in the Palestinian territories over possible crimes committed since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. The investigation began in March 2021.           “It is ongoing and extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7 October 2023,” Khan said. “In accordance with the Rome Statute, my Office has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of a State Party and with respect to the nationals of States Parties.”     Have war crimes been committed in Israel and Gaza and what laws govern the conflict?         Both Hamas and Israel have been accused of war crimes as the death toll from the conflict mounts. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed nearly 11,500 Palestinians since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws on medical sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Israel says its airstrikes intend to target Hamas commanders and infrastructure, following the militant group’s October 7 terror attacks which left 1,200 people dead in Israel and saw 240 taken hostage.           Israel’s siege of Gaza has included a near-total blockade of food, water and electricity, with exceptions for what the United Nations has called a “trickle” of humanitarian aid. On Friday however, Israel’s war cabinet agreed to allow two fuel tankers to enter Gaza each day to support water and sewage systems.           The conflict is covered by a complex system of international law developed after World War II, which attempts to balance humanitarian concerns and the military requirements of states.           A UN report said last month said it was collecting evidence of war crimes in the wake of the Hamas attack. The report said Israel may be committing the war crime of collective punishment, after the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the “complete siege” of Gaza. A number of prominent human rights groups concur with the UN’s assessment.           Earlier this month, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the October 7 attacks “atrocities”, saying they – and the holding of hostages – were war crimes.           But he added “the collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians.”           The South African government has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. In a statement last month, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation accused Israel of war crimes and said “the continual bombardment of civilian targets, the denial of the civilian population of Gaza of water, food, fuel, and electricity is prohibited under International Humanitarian Law and by Geneva Conventions.”           Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called accusations that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza “hogwash.” “We’re deliberately doing everything in our power to target the terrorists, and the civilians – as happens in every legitimate war – are sometimes what are called collateral damage,” he told NBC News on Sunday.           Israel is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court’s jurisdiction. That has not stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. Fatou Bensouda, then the ICC’s prosecutor, spent five years conducting a “painstaking preliminary examination” and concluded she was “satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.” But no arrests were made, and Bensouda left office in 2021.     Khan has said previously that the acts committed by Hamas on October 7 are “serious violations, if proven, of international humanitarian law.” He also stressed that “Israel has clear obligations in relation to its war with Hamas: Not just moral obligations, but legal obligations… It’s there in the Geneva Conventions. It’s there in black and white.”       CNN’s Christian Edwards contributed to this report.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,Alex Platt/CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/16/africa/sudan-investigation-rsf-enslavement-intl-cmd/index.html,"       Mahdi, 16, was blindfolded when a strange man felt for his biceps. He was looking for a “strong” boy to use as a farmhand.

And they kept hitting me,” Mahdi said of his captors and other unknown men. “I’d crouch down and they’d smack me in the neck.”           His harrowing testimony was among dozens – including accounts from women who alleged sexual enslavement – collected as part of an exclusive documentary by CNN about the humanitarian toll exacted by the ongoing fight between Sudan’s ruling military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).           The documentary, which will air this Sunday on “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper,” exposes an RSF-led campaign to enslave men and women in El Geneina, the largest city controlled by the paramilitary group in Sudan’s Darfur region.           A CNN team in the Chadian refugee camp of Adre, across the border from El Geneina, spoke to over a dozen witnesses who described the abduction of people en masse, with women forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for food and water and both men and women being traded by their captors. Their accounts shed further light on the violence in the genocide-scarred western Sudanese region over the past five months.           To protect the witnesses and survivors, CNN is not identifying them by their real names.           The apparent atrocities peaked after the RSF — which a CNN investigation has shown is backed by Russian mercenary group Wagner — captured El Geneina in mid-June. In the days that followed, a man named Khalid said he saw RSF-uniformed fighters escorting over a dozen shackled women into the El Geneina Industrial School, where he worked as a teacher.     Exclusive: Ukraine’s special services ‘likely’ behind strikes on Wagner-backed forces in Sudan, a Ukrainian military source says         “They flogged them with whips that they use on animals while the girls were screaming,” said Khalid, who told CNN he watched the scene unfold from his hiding place behind a pile of chopped wood in the school compound.           He only came out of hiding when night fell. Throughout the day, he said, he saw the fighters forcing women into classrooms at gunpoint, after which he said he heard sounds that indicated torture and rape.           Many of the women, Khalid said, appeared to have been trafficked from further north in Sudan — where women’s style of dress can display relative affluence, and where the tribal and racial mix is typified by generally lighter complexions.           Several Sudan-based rights groups, including the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA) and the government’s Combating Violence Against Women Unit, have told CNN that they believe the RSF abducted dozens of women from the capital, Khartoum, trafficking them to the paramilitary group’s strongholds in Darfur.           Rights group activists say they have spoken to scores of local sources who said the women appeared to have been sexually exploited by the RSF. In Adre, CNN spoke to four other witnesses, in addition to Khalid, who said they saw evidence of RSF trafficking women from northern Sudan.           One former abductee from Darfur— who CNN is not naming — said she saw a 4x4 vehicle roll up into an Arab neighborhood in El Geneina, carrying four women who appeared to be northern Sudanese women in the back.     Disturbing videos emerge showing atrocities against African ethnic groups in Darfur         She said she saw an RSF fighter approach the driver and ask how much he was willing to “sell” the women for.           She recalled hearing the driver boast that he had “handpicked the women” and that “no amount of cash” would make him release them to the RSF fighter.     ‘To us you are all slaves’           The trafficking of women from Arab-majority areas in the north of the country has become a widely discussed practice in Sudan, with widespread reports of RSF fighters demanding ransoms for their release.           In Darfur, captured women from non-Arab tribes appear to have been treated differently — the apparent sexual exploitation of women tends to involve shorter periods of captivity, and their abuse is reported by dozens of witnesses, survivors and activists to be racially fuelled.           The RSF, a largely Arab fighting force that has been accused of ethnically cleansing non-Arab tribes in Darfur, is widely named as the culprit of wide-scale sexual exploitation there.           The RSF has not responded to CNN’s request for comment about allegations of sexual enslavement.           The paramilitary group has previously denied allegations of conducting an ethnic cleansing campaign and committing sexual violence, in Darfur.           According to a Human Rights Watch report published in August, the RSF raped “several dozen women and girls” in El Geneina between late April and late June.           “The assailants appear to have targeted people because of their Masalit ethnicity and, in some cases, because they were known activists,” the report said.           Several former Darfuri abductees told CNN that fighters from the RSF and their Arab militia allies hurled racist abuse at them during their captivity. One 22-year-old woman named Raghm said she was kidnapped by an RSF-uniformed fighter from her home and detained in a brothel.           She said she heard her captor receiving money in exchange for her enslavement in the brothel — up to 7,000 Sudanese pounds, the equivalent of $10.           “He said to me: ‘To us you all are slaves. To us you are not free,’” said Raghm, who belongs to the Masalit tribe, the main target of the RSF’s revived apparent ethnic cleansing campaign.           Between beatings, she said she recalled him saying: “You are dirt. You are a disgrace.”           In Arabic, the word for ‘slave’ is a racial slur equivalent to the n-word.           Another woman told CNN she and the female members of her family were raped in captivity for four days.           “They locked my mother, myself, and my sisters up for four days and they raped us,” said 20-year-old Hawa. “On the fifth day, we fled. We saw some of (the Arab militia) on the street and they flogged us with whips. They told us to run for our lives, and cursed us, calling us donkeys and goats.           “The children were exhausted, barely walking a few steps before they collapsed,” she said.           CNN also found evidence of the enslavement of males as part of the attack on El Geneina.           Mahdi, the 16-year-old boy, told CNN he was kidnapped by the RSF with his brother and that he heard RSF fighters negotiating his “price” to work as a farmhand. He listened to the back-and-forth between his captors and other men while he was blindfolded, his hand and feet bound by rope.           They felt his biceps because they said they “wanted a strong one,” he told CNN.           He said he spent 10 days in the house that he was sold to before escaping and making it to the relative safety of Chad. The brother who was taken at the same time as him was killed by the RSF, he said.           The documentary to be aired Sunday is the latest in a series of CNN investigations into atrocities committed by the RSF in Sudan.           In recent months, CNN has uncovered how the Russian mercenary group Wagner has backed the RSF throughout this war, as well as evidence of arbitrary executions, wholesale destruction of homes, and forced displacement of Sudanese civilians.

world,Disturbing videos emerge showing atrocities against African ethnic groups in Darfur,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/africa/ethnic-groups-rounded-up-in-sudans-darfur-intl/index.html,"       Members of African ethnic groups in Sudan’s Darfur region appear to have been rounded up by members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and other Arab militias, according to videos and images verified and geolocated by CNN.           The videos emerged over the past two weeks. In one of them shared online and geolocated to Ardamata, an outlying district in El Geneina city in West Darfur state, racist slurs can be heard as men in fatigues refer to the captives as “dogs” and tell them to “gather here”.           In another cut of the video, the same men in fatigues can be seen whipping the men. At one point the men appear to be forced to run down the street. A man fires shots.     UN investigates reports of 13 mass graves in Sudan’s Darfur region         In another video, filmed less than a five-minute drive from the first video, the RSF logo appears visible on the uniforms of some of the men dressed in light colored fatigues who appear to be controlling the men huddled together on the ground. The word “liquidation” is mentioned and the words “slay them.”           The RSF on November 4 announced it had taken over the main army base in El Geneina (the 15th division headquarters), close to where these videos were filmed.           A Reuters reporter spoke to three men fleeing from Darfur into Chad on November 7 who said they had witnessed killings by Arab militias and RSF forces targeting the Masalit ethnic group in Ardamata, the news agency reported.           “Sickening reports and images coming from Ardamata, West Darfur, inc [sic] of assassinations, grave violations and massacres of civilians, following RSF takeover of area. Those with authority must uphold international humanitarian law, protect civilians, ensure rule of law and provide unfettered humanitarian access to vulnerable persons,” the UN’s deputy humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Toby Harward, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.     In another video that circulated on Tuesday, over a dozen bodies are piled together in what appears to be a mass grave. Three men inside the ditch throw sand on the bodies in an apparently half-hearted attempt to bury them. A voice from behind the camera barks orders at them.    It is unclear where the video was filmed, but one of the men helping bury the dead says he is from El Geneina. Halfway through the video, a man sits up from among the bodies, the dust falling off his face.    “Hey! That guy’s alive,” shouts a voice from behind the camera. “Kill him,” shouts another man shortly before the video ends.    CNN does not know the fate of the men concerned. It’s also unclear whether the men filmed in the ditch are the same men as those seen in the video running from RSF soldiers and militia loyal to the RSF.         The RSF has denied that “any incidents of ethnic cleansing or tribal conflict took place in the Ardmetta [Ardamata] area of El Geneina, West Darfur State.”           In a statement responding to questions from CNN last Wednesday, the RSF said it does not target civilians and that its forces are “fighting side-by-side with the people of Sudan to restore our country to its rightful path of civilian-led democratic rule.”           The paramilitary group said, however, that as a result of the conflict between RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the Ardamata neighborhood, their actions “did unfortunately result in the displacement of civilians” as the military zone is located amid residential areas.           “The conflict ended with our forces seizing control of the SAF 15th Infantry Division and liberating the division headquarters,” the statement said, adding that “since the division was liberated, Ardmetta has seen no further acts of aggression or armed conflict. Residents have returned to their homes, and security has stabilized, allowing life to resume as normal.”           Amid the most significant increase in displacement in months, aid agencies operating in Chad say arrivals from Sudan have been describing a new surge in killings and fighting in West Darfur.           Ethnic-related killings have intensified since fighting broke out mid-April between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, according to witnesses and aid groups operating in the region.           In September, the United Nations’ human rights body (UNJHRO) said it had received reports of at least 13 mass graves in El Geneina believed to contain civilians from the ethnic Masalit tribe who were allegedly killed in attacks by the RSF and allied Arab militias.           Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Tuesday that, following increased fighting in El Geneina, its teams working across the border in eastern Chad have seen an “immediate and major increase in the number of people arriving in the region.”           “Our people there in Ardamata were killed and displaced. Children are slaughtered, women’s money and belongings are robbed, and they can’t escape,” one Sudanese woman, Nabila Abdel Rahman, told Reuters on Tuesday.           In neighboring South Sudan, the UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said there has also been a “significant increase in Sudanese refugees in the past few days.”           MSF said a 27-year-old man had told staff at its hospital in Adré, Chad, that he fled El Geneina with 16 other people, but their group was attacked on the road to Chad. He said the attackers killed everyone, but he survived by playing dead.           “Eventually a new group of refugees arrived and helped him reach the border. He has multiple bullet wounds on his hands and legs,” the MSF news release said.           The incidents described to aid agencies follow a pattern of similar alleged abuses by the RSF since the conflict began, according to multiple CNN reports.           “In the first three days of November, we have seen more new arrivals of Sudanese refugees than during the whole previous month; about 7,000 people crossed the border,” MSF outreach coordinator, Stephanie Hoffmann, said.           UN refugee agency (UNHCR) director of external relations Dominique Hyde said she witnessed a surge in human suffering when she visited Sudan last week.           In the Darfur region, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF has caused even more displacement with thousands struggling to find shelter and many sleeping under trees by the roadside, a UNCHR news release said.     Landmark buildings ablaze in Khartoum as Sudan fighting erupts         “Child malnutrition is rampant, women are being raped, violence prevails and entire families are sleeping outside with no roof over their heads,” Hyde wrote on X, formerly Twitter.           Since the war in Sudan broke out in April, 4.5 million people have been internally displaced and an estimated 1.2 million have fled to neighbouring countries, according to UNHCR.           On November 7, the US State Department announced that during talks in Jeddah, the SAF and RSF “committed to take steps to facilitate increased humanitarian assistance, and to implement confidence-building measures.”           They were unable to agree on a ceasefire implementation.           “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, IGAD, also on behalf of the African Union, and the United States call upon the SAF and RSF to put the Sudanese people first, silence the guns, and seek a negotiated end to this needless war,” a joint statement from the talks released by the State Department said.     They came after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called for an “immediate cessation of attacks” in El Fasher in North Darfur.           “The United States is deeply troubled by reports of an imminent large-scale attack by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on El Fasher, North Darfur, that would subject civilians, including hundreds of thousands of displaced persons – many of whom only recently fled to El Fasher from other areas – to extreme danger,” Blinken said in a press statement on November 2.

world,Mass visa cancellations at Saudi airport puts relations with Nigeria in spotlight,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/16/africa/mass-visa-cancellations-at-saudi-airport-puts-relations-with-nigeria-in-spotlight/index.html,"       Diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have come under scrutiny after 177 Nigerians were refused entry to the country on Monday.           Nigeria’s foreign ministry said only 87 of 264 Nigerian nationals who landed in Jeddah on an Air Peace flight Monday were allowed to enter. All the others had their visas cancelled and were deported.           According to local media reports, some of the passengers were pilgrims hoping to perform the lesser Hajj (the Umrah) in Mecca, the Islamic holy city.           The mass cancellation of visas occurred as Nigera’s President Bola Tinubu was still in Saudi Arabia after holding bilateral talks with the Saudi government.           After a furor on social media, the Saudi embassy in Nigeria said that the affected passengers “didn’t fulfill the entry conditions and requirements in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Kingdom, as they submitted incorrect information to obtain a category of visa that doesn’t apply to them, which was discovered upon their arrival.”           Saudi Arabia requires pilgrims to hold specific travel documents (Umrah or Hajj visas) for pilgrimage. Holders of tourist visas are barred from performing Hajj or Umrah during the Hajj season, according to regulations by the country’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah.           It’s not immediately clear what type of visas the deported Nigerians had traveled with. However, Air Peace, the Nigerian carrier that flew the Nigerians into Jeddah said it was “shocked” that the visas of its passengers were revoked by Saudi Arabia on arrival because it “strictly followed the profiling procedures stipulated by Saudi Arabian authorities.”           “The visas of all the passengers on the said flight to Jeddah … were checked and verified through the requisite procedures and were vetted to be valid before departure,” the airline said in a statement Wednesday, adding that: “No notice of cancelation or any form of denial from the Saudi authorities was received against any of these passengers despite the live transmission of their details.”           The Saudi statement added the cancellations were not limited to Nigerian citizens, adding that: “… all passengers should review all the documents to determine their conformity with the conditions prior to departing from their countries to the Kingdom.”           Commentators said the incident was embarrassing for Nigeria as its president was still in the country after attending the Saudi-Africa Summit held last Friday. He left Thursday morning for Guinea Bissau for Independence Day celebrations, the presidency said.           “This is obviously a very big diplomatic slap in the face,” Victor Okhai, an advisory board member of the African Diaspora Foundation, a group that advocates the welfare of the African diaspora, told CNN.           “There was a total lack of sensitivity (by Saudi officials) because the president (of Nigeria) was visiting that country,” Okhai said.           A former Nigerian presidential aide, Reno Omokiri, said Saudi Arabia’s action was “embarrassing” as well as a blight on bilateral relations between both countries.           “Why would the Saudis revoke the visas of over a hundred passengers on an Air Peace flight to Jeddah, especially as Nigeria’s President is currently in Saudi Arabia? That does not augur well for bilateral relations. It is most embarrassing … (and) demonstrates disdain for Nigeria as a whole,” Omokri posted on X, formerly known as Twitter earlier in the week.     UAE official says visa restrictions not lifted for Nigerians         Other Nigerians called for the Saudi ambassador to the country to be summoned.           Nigerians have also faced visa entry issues in other countries in the region.           Saudi’s neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, has yet to lift a year-long visa ban on Nigerian travelers despite interventions by Tinubu.           Tinubu’s office released a statement announcing the end of the ban shortly after his meeting with UAE leader Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in September. However, a UAE official told CNN the embargo was yet to be lifted.           Saudi Arabia is a popular pilgrimage destination for thousands of Nigerian Muslims.           However, Monday’s deportation of Nigerian nationals is not the first time travelers have been refused entry to Saudi Arabia.     Saudi Arabia turns back 1,000 female pilgrims from Nigeria         In 2012, authorities deported more than 1,000 female pilgrims from Nigeria because they were unaccompanied by male chaperones when they arrived in the country.           Nigeria’s government says it is working to avoid a recurrence.           “Notwithstanding the fact that it is the prerogative of a sovereign nation to determine who is permitted entry into its territory, Nigeria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are traditional and strategic partners, who are willing to guard against reoccurrence of this unfortunate incident,” its foreign ministry said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Zimbabwe opposition party says activist found dead after abduction,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/14/africa/zimbabwe-opposition-party-says-activist-found-dead-after-abduction/index.html,"       A Zimbabwe opposition activist has been found dead after he was abducted on Saturday during a political campaign just outside Harare, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party said late on Monday, the second abduction in weeks of an opposition party member.           Tapfumaneyi Masaya was reportedly bundled into a vehicle by unknown men while campaigning for main opposition party CCC’s candidate ahead of by-elections on Dec. 9, the party said.           CCC spokesperson Promise Mkwananzi told Reuters on Tuesday that Masaya was tortured and dumped on the outskirts of Harare.           Masaya’s body was later moved to a mortuary at Parirenyatwa Hospital, about 5km from central Harare, where it was identified by CCC members who had been searching for him, Mkwananzi said.           Reuters could not independently verify the events.     Zimbabwe’s president faces outrage after appointing son and nephew as government ministers         Zimbabwe has a long history of forced disappearances and deaths of political activists dating back to the 80s. The opposition has often accused the ruling ZANU-PF party of torture and deaths of its activists.           Masaya’s abduction and killing comes barely two weeks after CCC lawmaker Takudzwa Ngadziore was abducted, tortured and dumped about 50km north of Harare by armed men. He survived the attack.           Police said on Monday an investigation had been launched after a body was discovered in the vicinity of where the CCC said Masaya was found, but that the victim’s identity was yet to be established.           Police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told Reuters on Tuesday that there were no further updates.           “We urge the police to do their work and ensure that all these abductors are promptly and effectively brought to justice,” said Mkwananzi.           Zimbabwe’s opposition parties have been calling for a fresh election since President Emmerson Mnangagwa secured a second term in August. CCC leader Nelson Chamisa described the vote as a “gigantic fraud,” while the ruling ZANU-PF party has denied the fraud claims.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/16/americas/argentina-election-peso-economy-analysis-intl/index.html,"       When voters go to the polls this Sunday to elect Argentina’s next president, they will have to choose not only between two candidates, but between two opposite ideas of what type of country they want to live in.           That is an old adage in the era of identity politics. Still, it is hardly truer anywhere than in Buenos Aires, where Sergio Massa, the country’s current finance minister and a scion of the political establishment, is squaring off against Javier Milei, a former television pundit who entered politics less than 36 months ago.           The runoff between Massa, from the government coalition Union por la Patria (Union for the Homeland), and Milei of La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), brings to an end a polarizing political campaign that has seen a series of surprising reversals, beginning in August when Milei stunned the country with a victory in a preliminary vote. After a weaker showing in the election’s first round in October, Milei was seen as being on the backfoot; this week he is once again leading in the polls.           One of the biggest questions now facing voters in this soccer-obsessed nation is: which of these two political polar opposites, both of whom played as goalkeepers in their youth, is the safest pair of hands for an economy currently suffering some of the highest inflation in the world?           More than 35 million Argentinians will be asked to cast their vote on Sunday on whether they trust Massa to lead the country out of its worst economic crisis of the past two decades through familiar policies that have failed before, or to dive into the unknown with Milei who proposes the radical idea of ditching the Argentinian peso in favor of the US dollar as national currency.           Argentine law prohibits the publication of opinion polls up to eight days ahead of the vote, but recent results from the past few weeks have shown the candidates almost neck-and-neck, and most analysts believe the election will be close.           On a personal level, the two candidates could not be more different: Massa is a family man who has dreamt of becoming a politician since he was 11 years old and has spent his career in and out of elected office; Milei lives alone with five English mastiffs – all genetically identical clones from a previous pet – and was elected to Congress in 2021.           Massa has carefully selected his political alliances to propel his ascent to government, while Milei rose to fame with political stunts, like wielding a chainsaw at rallies, and vowing to unleash a wrecking ball on the administrative class his opponent represents.           It is Milei who has attracted the most attention this year, not only because of his political style – on top of wielding chainsaws, he’s prone to raging outbursts and has embraced the nickname of ‘The Crazy One’ since climbing in the polls – but also because his proposed reforms would decisively shift Argentina to the right.           Outside of his controversial plan for dollarization, his political program includes slashing regulations on gun control and transferring authority over the penitentiary system from civilians to the military; both measures part of a tough-on-crime approach.     The ‘chainsaw’ candidate challenging Argentina’s left and right         Milei proposes using public funds to support families who choose to educate their children privately – as a child he attended a Catholic private school in Buenos Aires – and privatizing the health sector, which in Argentina has always been in public hands in Argentina.           In recent weeks, Milei triggered an uproar when it appeared he was in favor of opening a market for organ transplants, although he later retracted his declarations.           He was similarly forced to apologize after calling Pope Francis, who is from Argentina and is seen as an icon of progressive politics in South America, “an envoy of Satan” in 2017. The apology, however, did not stop him from accusing Francis of siding with “bloodthirsty dictators” in an interview with right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson in September.           At university, Milei studied economics and idolized Milton Friedman, to the point of naming one of his beloved dogs after the free-market theorist.           But his most controversial proposal concerns public finances, as he plans to drastically cut government spending and, famously, eliminate the central bank and completely dollarize the country.           The idea to dollarize is not new – two other nations in Latin America, Ecuador and El Salvador, have dollarized in the past 30 years to combat inflation – but it’s untested in a country as big as Argentina.           Milei’s pitch is simple: Argentina’s rate of inflation, regularly among the highest in the world, is caused by politicians and central bankers who print new pesos to finance their social programs and electoral promises. As a result, the peso loses value, and everyone gets poorer. To fix the problem, Argentina should abandon the peso and adopt the dollar, whose value is set by the US Federal Reserve and cannot be printed at will.           The downside of dollarization is that a nation loses the power to influence the economy through monetary policy. For that reason critics of dollarization often refer to it as a straightjacket.           Because Argentina’s inflation rate is so high – just this week new data revealed prices had risen 142% from 2023 – the proposal has attracted interest from foreign institutions as well.           In recent months, for example, The Economist, a conservative international publication, warned against the allure of dollarization, arguing that Argentina does not possess enough dollars to finance the currency switch and that the downsides would far outweigh the benefits.           Conversely, analysts from the Cato Institute, a US-based rightwing economics think tank, favor the move as the only viable strategy to tame what is a decades-long problem.     Javier Milei wants Argentina to swap the peso for the US dollar. Here’s what that could mean         In the early 1990s the Argentinian peso was ‘pegged’ to the dollar, which meant its value was fixed to the US currency, but Argentinians would still use pesos for their shopping.           Inflation came roaring back once the currency was allowed to float.           Massa has criticized the plan for dollarization as a surrender of national sovereignty and attempted to show that the government’s current actions are already paying dividends.           While still high – 142% year on year – , inflation in October was 35% lower than in September.           Other mainstream politicians, including former the President Mauricio Macri and another former election candidate, Patricia Bullrich, have endorsed Milei despite sharing some reservations on dollarization.           Interest in this Sunday’s elections goes far beyond Argentina’s borders.           Abandoning a tradition of non-intervention in another country’s elections, leftwing politicians in the region including Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Colombia’s Gustavo Petro and Spain’s José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero have endorsed Massa.           Milei meanwhile can count on the support of Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro, Peruvian-Spanish writer Mario Vargas Llosa and Spanish conservative former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.           The stakes are high because a victory for Milei could be seen as a boost for far-right populist politicians like Bolsonaro and former US President Donald Trump just ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, while a win by Massa would be a showcase for center-left policies.           Polls close at 6 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET) and the vote count is expected to be quick – barring any unforeseen problems or objections, that is.           Milei appeared to question the results of the first round of voting in October, although his party did not formally appeal.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Mexico’s first openly non-binary magistrate and prominent LGBTQ activist found dead,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/14/americas/mexico-non-binary-magistrate-jesus-ociel-baena-saucedo-dead-intl-hnk/index.html," Mexico’s first openly non-binary magistrate and prominent LGBTQ activist Jesús Ociel Baena Saucedo was found dead at home in the central state of Aguascalientes on Monday.           A second person, who was identified as Baena’s romantic partner, was also found dead in the home where they both resided, according to authorities in Aguascalientes, the state nearly 500 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of the capital city.           Mexico’s Security Minister Rosa Icela Rodríguez said the cause of death is so far unknown, while Aguascalientes’ Attorney General Jesús Figueroa said there is no evidence of foul play for the moment.           “The investigation is going to be done,” Rodríguez said during President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily press conference, also on Monday.           The prosecutor’s office said that preliminary findings indicate that no traces of blood were found outside the crime scene, that there was no damage found in the accessways to the home, and that they are ruling out the “presence of a third person” involved in the deaths. The office added that “one of the lifeless bodies found was holding a cutting instrument.”           Figueroa said the case would be investigated from a gender perspective because Baena identified as a non-binary person, though there was no mention of the deaths being potentially linked to a hate crime.           For a little over a year, Baena was a member of the central Mexican state of Aguascalientes’ Electoral Tribunal.           Baena told CNN en Español in October last year that there was no record in Latin America of a non-binary magistrate. Baena said that being the first was an achievement and recognition for years of work in favor of LGBTQ rights.           “I want to send the message that the LGBTQ population can access these spaces, that there is a possibility, that we have people with enough of a profile that with their own merits can access these spaces where decisions are made,” Baena said at the time.           While Latin America has made impressive progress on marriage equality over the decades, LGBTQ+ activists and gender minorities continue to suffer high levels of violence and discrimination from social and religious conservatives.           Same-sex marriage was made legal across all 32 states of Mexico after Tamaulipas became the last state that voted to authorize such unions in 2022.           Mexico’s Guadalajara city also co-hosted the Gay Games this month, alongside Hong Kong, marking a first for both continents to host the gender inclusive sporting event amidst opposition from conservative politicians.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Protests against copper mine deal turn deadly in Panama,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/americas/demonstrators-killed-mining-protests-panama/index.html,"       Anti-mining protests that have roiled Panama for the last two weeks turned deadly on Tuesday when a man allegedly shot and killed two demonstrators, according to police.           A chilling video posted by bystanders on X, formerly known as Twitter, showed a disheveled elderly man apparently frustrated with the logjam trying to force the protestors to remove a barrier blocking the Pan American highway about 50 miles south of the capital, before pulling out a pistol and opening fire. Panama’s National Police later said they arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the shooting.           The unusual scene of violence is the latest flashpoint in some of the largest protests to hit the Central American nation since Panamanians flooded the streets en masse to demonstrate against the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega in the 1980s.           For weeks, tens of thousands of protestors have vented their fury at a controversial mining contract given to Minera Panama, the local subsidiary of a Canadian mining company, to extract copper, a key component in electric car batteries.           The contract allows Canada’s First Quantum Minerals to restart an open-pit copper mine surrounded by rain forest for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for another 20 years.           Environmentalists say the mine could contaminate drinking water and devastate tracts of the 32,000 acres the company negotiated use of, in exchange for yearly payments of $375 million.           Panama’s government has promised, however, that the mine will bring thousands of jobs in addition to the badly needed revenue. First Quantum Minerals did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the protests.           Opposition to the mine has united environmentalists, indigenous groups and teachers’ and construction unions who see allegations of backroom dealings between the government and the mining company as further evidence of widespread official corruption.           The protestors accuse the government of selling off the nation’s natural resources at the same moment many Panamanians have been hit with the costs of rising inflation and are feeling the impacts of climate change.           “Panamanians are suffering from lack of water, suffering from droughts, principally in the central provinces, animals that die, harvests that don’t happen,” environmental activist Martita Cornejo told CNN en Español.           “The government did not guage the opposition from Panamanian society to a mining contract.”           But former US ambassador to Panama John Feeley said while much of the outrage is real, the new contract announcement has also presented an opportunity for some groups to try to force their own concessions and win sweetheart deals from the government.           “This is the horrible thing about Panama: Even when you protest corruption, you are probably facilitating it as well,” he said.           Weeks of road blocks set up by protesters have shut down the country, preventing farmers from bringing crops to market and sequestering Panamanians in their homes. According to Panama’s association of company executives, the standstill inflicts $80 million in daily losses to local businesses. Celebrations to mark Panama’s independence from Colombia in 1903 were also widely cancelled last week.           Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo has defended the mining deal after its announcement on October 20, saying the agreement would create jobs and revenue for Panama.           The mine had provided a rare economic bright spot for Panama where tourism has been slow to recover from the pandemic and the drought has reduced traffic though the Panama Canal, which is expected to a cause a drop of revenue of $200 million in 2024.           “We made the right decision, not the easiest one,” Cortizo said. “After a difficult and complicated negotiation for more than two years, a contract was agreed in 2023 between the company Minera Panama and the Panamanian State, which guarantees much better terms and conditions for the country.”           But as the protests have dragged on, Panama’s government has offered concessions that have done little to deflate the crisis: Last week, congress passed a moratorium on all future metal mining and Cortizo called for a nationwide referendum in December on the controversial project.           In 2017, Panama’s Supreme Court declared another contract to operate the copper mine as unconstitutional, forcing the mining company and government to renegotiate the deal.           Opponents now say they are hopeful that an announcement by Panama’s Supreme Court this week that it is examining the legality of the contract could once again kill the deal.           Whatever the resolution to the crisis, it may be too late to repair the damage done to Panama’s reputation in the region as a rare bastion of political and economic stability.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Pablo Escobar’s ‘cocaine hippos’ face Colombian government cull,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/americas/pablo-escobars-cocaine-hippos-face-cull-colombia-intl-scli-scn/index.html," Pablo Escobar’s notorious “cocaine hippos” are facing a cull, according to a statement from Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development Thursday.           The herd, which the Colombian government said currently stands at 169 animals, has rapidly reproduced from the original population of one male and three females the drug kingpin owned as part of his private collection of exotic creatures.           After Escobar’s death in 1993, authorities relocated most of the other animals in the collection, but not the hippos – because they were too difficult to transport. Free from any natural predator, the rising population poses an environmental challenge. If “strong measures” are not taken to control them, the population could boom to “1,000 individuals by 2035,” the statement said.           This new phase to control the hippo population involves three strategies: sterilization, relocation and “ethical euthanasia,” it added.           “All three strategies have to work together,” Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said in the statement. “Here we are in a race against time in terms of the permanent environmental and ecosystem impacts that are being generated and that is why we cannot say that only one strategy is effective for our objective, which is to control the population.”           In 2021, scientists recommended culling the hippos to prevent long-term negative effects, but other scientists are calling instead for a castration program, citing concerns over animal welfare.     Pablo Escobar ‘cocaine hippo’ dies in Colombia after being hit by car         Between 2011 and 2019, four males were castrated and two females were sterilized, but this did little to slow the hippos’ progress. Putting the hippos on birth control was similarly ineffective. There have also been plans to relocate some of the population to India, the Philippines and Mexico, with the logistics of sending 60 to India currently being analyzed, the statement said.           “We are looking to implement this plan in the shortest possible time, precisely so that the impacts cease,” Muhamad explained.           According to the ministry statement, sterilization will cost the country an average of 40 million pesos ($10,000) per animal, and will begin from next week, with an aim to sterilize 40 a year.           The minister concluded by emphasizing that hippos have been declared an “invasive exotic” with “aggressive characteristics,” and that “their presence represents a threat to ecosystems and risks for the communities that surround them.”           Research has shown negative effects of hippo waste on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans. Hippos also pose a threat to agriculture and to the security of people in affected areas, according to a 2021 study. In April, a hippo descended from Escobar’s collection died after being hit by a car.     Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the rate at which the hippos will be sterilized.

world,Caroline Chia/Reuters/File,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/asia/australia-albanese-china-navy-dangerous-conduct-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Australia’s prime minister has accused the Chinese navy of “dangerous, unsafe and unprofessional” conduct after an incident in international waters near Japan, marking a potential friction point with Beijing weeks after he visited the Chinese capital to stabilize relations.           Australian divers aboard the long-range frigate HMAS Toowoomba were trying to clear fishing nets from its propellers on November 14 when a Chinese destroyer approached, Australia’s Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement Saturday.           Despite being warned that a diving operation was underway, the Chinese destroyer operated its sonar in a manner that “posed a risk to the safety of the Australian divers who were forced to exit the water,” the statement said.           Medical assessments found the divers had sustained minor injuries, the statement added.           In an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “very concerned” by the incident, adding that “one person suffered an injury as a result of the actions of China.”           Albanese refused to confirm whether he raised the incident with Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met at the APEC summit in San Fransisco last Thursday.           “I can assure you that we raised these issues in the appropriate way and very clearly, unequivocally. And China, there’s no misunderstanding as to Australia’s view on this,” he said.           China’s Defense Ministry on Monday dismissed Australia’s accusations as “completely inconsistent with the facts.”           Wu Qian, a ministry spokesperson, said the Chinese destroyer, Ningbo, had been tracking and monitoring the Australian frigate in accordance with international laws and regulations.           “The Chinese ship maintained a safe distance from the Australian ship and didn’t engage in any activities that might affect the Australian diving operations,” Wu said in a statement.           “We urge Australia to respect the facts, stop making reckless and irresponsible accusations against China, and do more things that are conducive to enhancing the accumulation of mutual trust between two sides.”           Asked about the incident at a regular news briefing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: “We hope relevant parties can stop causing troubles at China’s doorstep and work with China to jointly safeguard the momentum of improving China-Australia relations.”           The incident took place a week after Albanese paid a landmark visit to Beijing – the first trip by an Australian leader in seven years – to stabilize rocky bilateral ties after years of economic tension.           In the Sky News interview, Albanese sidestepped a question on whether the incident will make bilateral relations “look shaky” now.           “Well, what I said when I was in China is that we will cooperate where we can but disagree where we must. And this is one of those times where we disagree with the action of China,” Albanese said.           “We’ve made it clear that we disagree with what occurred, that we have the strongest possible objection, and that this sort of event should not occur.”           In his statement Saturday, Marles said the Australian government had expressed “serious concerns” to the Chinese government over what it called an “unsafe and unprofessional” interaction with a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) destroyer.           Medical assessments found the divers had sustained minor injuries, “likely due to being subjected to the sonar pulses from the Chinese destroyer,” the statement said.           Military ships use sonar to detect and locate objects in the water. Divers exposed to high levels of underwater sound can suffer from “dizziness, hearing damage or other injuries to other sensitive organs,” depending on the frequency and intensity of the sound, according to the London-based Diving Medical Advisory Committee.           The HMAS Toowoomba had been in Japan’s exclusive economic zone conducting operations in support of United Nations sanctions enforcement and was enroute to commence a scheduled port visit to Japan, according to Marles’ statement.           “Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner,” Marles said.           “Defense has for decades undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region and does so in accordance with international law, exercising the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace.”           China’s navy and air forces have been accused of unsafe practices by US and Canadian militaries in multiple close encounters in the East and South China seas in recent months.           Earlier this month, the Canadian military said a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of its helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea on October 29, an operation it said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.           In response, China blamed Canada for carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea.           Ray Powell, director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University, said it will likely never be known if the order to use the sonar came from commanders in Beijing or at a lower level, maybe the Chinese destroyer captain himself.           “Either is disturbing, as the former would indicate mendacity at very senior levels, while the latter would demonstrate a mendacious military culture,” said Powell, a former US Air Force officer.           “Were the roles reversed, it seems clear to me that an Australian naval commander who did the same thing would be relieved of command, or worse. Yet nobody believes such action is even being considered by Beijing,” Powell said.       CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed reporting.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Australian prime minister accuses Chinese navy of ‘dangerous’ conduct,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/asia/australia-albanese-china-navy-dangerous-conduct-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Australia’s prime minister has accused the Chinese navy of “dangerous, unsafe and unprofessional” conduct after an incident in international waters near Japan, marking a potential friction point with Beijing weeks after he visited the Chinese capital to stabilize relations.           Australian divers aboard the long-range frigate HMAS Toowoomba were trying to clear fishing nets from its propellers on November 14 when a Chinese destroyer approached, Australia’s Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a statement Saturday.           Despite being warned that a diving operation was underway, the Chinese destroyer operated its sonar in a manner that “posed a risk to the safety of the Australian divers who were forced to exit the water,” the statement said.           Medical assessments found the divers had sustained minor injuries, the statement added.           In an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “very concerned” by the incident, adding that “one person suffered an injury as a result of the actions of China.”           Albanese refused to confirm whether he raised the incident with Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met at the APEC summit in San Fransisco last Thursday.           “I can assure you that we raised these issues in the appropriate way and very clearly, unequivocally. And China, there’s no misunderstanding as to Australia’s view on this,” he said.           China’s Defense Ministry on Monday dismissed Australia’s accusations as “completely inconsistent with the facts.”           Wu Qian, a ministry spokesperson, said the Chinese destroyer, Ningbo, had been tracking and monitoring the Australian frigate in accordance with international laws and regulations.           “The Chinese ship maintained a safe distance from the Australian ship and didn’t engage in any activities that might affect the Australian diving operations,” Wu said in a statement.           “We urge Australia to respect the facts, stop making reckless and irresponsible accusations against China, and do more things that are conducive to enhancing the accumulation of mutual trust between two sides.”           Asked about the incident at a regular news briefing on Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: “We hope relevant parties can stop causing troubles at China’s doorstep and work with China to jointly safeguard the momentum of improving China-Australia relations.”           The incident took place a week after Albanese paid a landmark visit to Beijing – the first trip by an Australian leader in seven years – to stabilize rocky bilateral ties after years of economic tension.           In the Sky News interview, Albanese sidestepped a question on whether the incident will make bilateral relations “look shaky” now.           “Well, what I said when I was in China is that we will cooperate where we can but disagree where we must. And this is one of those times where we disagree with the action of China,” Albanese said.           “We’ve made it clear that we disagree with what occurred, that we have the strongest possible objection, and that this sort of event should not occur.”           In his statement Saturday, Marles said the Australian government had expressed “serious concerns” to the Chinese government over what it called an “unsafe and unprofessional” interaction with a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) destroyer.

world,Civilians caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates between Myanmar military and armed group,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/asia/civilians-in-crossfire-myanmar-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Renewed hostilities between the Myanmar military and ethnic minority armed group the Arakan Army (AA) have spread to various townships in western Myanmar, including Pauktaw, where civilians have been caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates.           A former member of parliament from Pauktaw township, who asked not to be identified due to safety concerns, told CNN on Saturday that he had lost contact with people from the town and did not know what is happening.           “I left the town the day the fighting broke out. But there are elderly people, sick people and families with young children left as they could not make haste,” he said.           “It’s raining and a storm is coming too. It’s a devastating situation. It breaks my heart to see people in such a situation.”           Ongoing clashes between the Arakan Army and the military began in the Rathedaung township on November 13 and have since spread to the townships of Maungdaw, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, and Paletwa, according to a statement from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Friday.           The renewed fighting has displaced more than 26,000 people in the country’s western Rakhine state since Monday, according to UNOCHA.           The two parties had previously established an informal ceasefire in November 2022, according to the UN, but fighting broke out after the Arakan Army reportedly attacked two border posts.           In a statement released on Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures brought the total number of internally displaced people due to the conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000. It added that there had been reports of military shelling in Arakan Army-controlled areas.           Myanmar’s military had also conducted at least one operation backed by air and naval support, UNOCHA said.           Myanmar military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said during a briefing Friday that the Myanmar army and police force had retaken the Pauktaw police station and that the town “was already under control” of the military.           Most humanitarian activities have been suspended due to the resurgence of the conflict and “virtually all roads and waterways” between townships in Rakhine have been blocked, according to OCHA.           Battles between the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war.           Airstrikes and ground attacks on what the Myanmar military calls “terrorist” targets have been occurred regularly since 2021 and have killed thousands of civilians to date, including children, according to monitoring groups.     Renewed fighting in Myanmar has displaced 26,000 people since Monday, UN says         Whole villages have been burned down by junta soldiers and schools, clinics and hospitals destroyed.           The son of a man from Pauktow who was killed as a result of the latest hostilities, told CNN that his father had been “hit by pieces of artillery at a meditation center” after Myanmar’s State Administration Council (SAC) soldiers started shooting at him “constantly.”           “I was told he was crying out of pain, I can’t imagine how he would be suffering in a pool of blood. The next morning, I got a call that he passed away at night,” the man said.           U Nan Diya, Chaung Suak village’s abbot monk, told CNN that he had been assisting three fellow villagers – a father sick with heart disease, accompanied by his daughter and son-in-law.           Despite the family reaching a hospital two days before hostilities resumed, they remained stranded in a house in Pauktaw after the town “turned into a war zone,” U Nan Diya said.           The sick man’s daughter had attempted to look for a boat to return to their village but was arrested by soldiers on Friday, he added.           U Nan Diya said the 60-year-old man with heart disease was getting worse without medication. “(His) family wants him at their home instead of letting him die at a stranger’s house but nobody can go out or use the water route because the military navy is stationed in the sea, shooting everyone they see,” he said.           “The sick man can’t die peacefully.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

In a statement Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures bring the total number of internally displaced people due to conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000.           Eleven deaths and more than 30 injuries have been reported since an informal ceasefire agreed a year ago broke on November 13, the statement read.           More than 100 people have reportedly been detained by the MAF and five by the AA, it added.     Battles between the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war.

world,This conservationist lost his eye in a tiger attack — but he’s still fighting to protect the king of the jungle,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/13/asia/bhadai-tharu-tiger-nepal-conservation-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,"       In the Bardiya region of Nepal, near the western border with India, Bhadai Tharu grew up with tales of tigers.           They were not common in the forests around his home. At the turn of the 20th century, more than 100,000 tigers roamed Asia. But by the time Tharu was growing up in the 1970s, the tiger population had dwindled to just 20% of its peak.         It didn’t stop his parents from narrating stories about them when he was a child. Living in the forested region where tigers were king of the jungle, the big cats took on a kind of mythical quality, Tharu says: on the rare occasion one ventured into the village, it was taken as a sign of the gods’ displeasure. The villagers would set up a “Madhwa, a place of worship for tigers as deities,” a ritual that continues to this day, he says. As an adult, he became involved in forest conservation and was committed to protecting their habitat.           So when a tiger attacked Tharu in 2004, causing him to lose an eye, he felt as if he was being punished.           “I was furious with the tiger,” he says. “Inside, I was seething with anger, and I even felt the urge to return to the jungle and seek vengeance against the tiger.”           But as time passed, Tharu says his anger faded. “I came to realize that the jungle is the tiger’s home, and it only attacked me out of fear that I might harm its habitat.”           He recalls that on the day of his attack, there were around 100 to 150 community members in the forest collecting wood and grass, which he was overseeing as chairman of the community forests initiative.           “People were dispersed throughout the forest, and the tiger found itself surrounded by humans, unable to find an escape route,” he says. “The tiger that attacked me felt scared. It could have killed me, but it just attacked and left.”           Tharu recommitted himself to protecting Nepal’s tiger population — as well as preventing human-wildlife conflict in the region.           Back in the 1980s, the land around Tharu’s village, Khata, was barren and deforested. But in 2001, the land was handed over to local communities, who rely on the forest for materials and sustenance, says Tharu.           This area, known as the Khata corridor, links the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, India, and Nepal’s Bardiya National Park. The forest grew from 115 hectares to 3,800 hectares, and in 2021 won the WWF’s Conservation Excellence Award. And as the forest was restored, the wildlife returned too, says Tharu — including tigers.           Bardiya National Park and the Khata corridor are part of the Terai Arc Landscape, a 24,710 square kilometer area along the Nepal-India border that covers six protected areas including forests and wetlands. In 2010, Nepal set a goal to double the number of tigers from 121 to 250 — but it exceeded that target, tripling the population to 355, according to WWF.           The Khata corridor has “significantly contributed to tiger conservation” in the region, in particular the crackdown on poaching, which has been “completely eradicated,” says Umesh Paudel, a researcher based at the Bardiya base of the Nepalese non-profit National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), one of several organizations that support the community forests initiative.           “Typically, wildlife does not consider such corridors their permanent habitat,” says Paudel. Prior to the conservation efforts, tigers were rarely spotted by cameras in the corridor — but Paudel says that in the 2021 tiger census, it was found that four tigers were permanently living in the Khata corridor.           Territorial in nature, tigers need up to 58 square miles to roam and constantly seek new habitats — and the corridor has allowed the population to move freely and flourish, says Paudel.           While the growing tiger population is a great conservation success story, the region is now facing a new problem: escalating human-wildlife conflict.           Tiger attacks like Tharu’s were a rare occurrence in 2004. But as the tiger population increases, these attacks are becoming more frequent, and since 2019, there have been at least 34 fatal attacks on people in the Banke and Bardiya National Parks alone, says Paudel. Around 6,000 communities live in the corridor, and a busy highway runs through the middle, creating more opportunities for conflict.           The NTNC monitors the tigers with camera traps and identifies potentially problematic tigers. After an attack, a tiger will often revisit the site, says Paudel, allowing the team to profile the animal and analyze behavior patterns.           “If we ascertain that these tigers are frequently involved in human casualties, we recommend their capture,” he says, adding this is carried out by a team comprising the Nepalese Army, the National Park office, and NTNC.           In addition to tracking and monitoring the tigers, the NTNC also manages the local deer population — the tiger’s main prey — to ensure there is enough food, and that the correct areas of the park, away from villages, are most attractive for the deer to live in. “This practice helps in containing tigers within the national park, thereby minimizing conflicts within the community,” says Paudel.           Similarly, the creation of artificial watering holes has also helped to disperse the tiger population and direct animals away from local communities.           However, tiger population growth isn’t the only reason behind the increased human-wildlife conflict, says Paudel. “Our community members are encroaching upon wildlife habitats, venturing into the forests alone, and disturbing the natural habitat. As a result of this disturbance, they often encounter attacks from tigers.”           It is easier to influence human behavior than change the tigers, says Paudel, and so NTNC also works on community outreach to educate and empower, and prevent attacks by installing infrastructure such as fences and shelters.           “It is crucial to prioritize community development, to ensure that communities become advocates for tiger conservation,” Paudel adds.           Even as human-animal conflicts increase, Tharu says the local communities are happy to see the tiger population flourish. As apex predators, tigers are a keystone species which means that they are essential to the forest ecosystem that the surrounding communities rely on for their homes, sustenance and livelihoods. “The tigers were once endangered, and now they are back. It is good news for us,” Tharu says.           By teaching communities to take precautions, he hopes that attacks can be reduced too. “Every being has equal rights on the earth,” he says.

world,Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/travel/american-airlines-wheelchair-tarmac-video/index.html,"       American Airlines said it is reviewing a video posted on TikTok that shows a baggage handler releasing a passenger’s wheelchair to slide down a jet bridge chute, where it crashed into a metal barrier, flipped over and tumbled onto an airport tarmac.           The post, which has millions of views, has brought renewed attention to the traveling plight of millions of disabled Americans. According to the Paralyzed Veterans of America nonprofit, more than 31 wheelchairs were damaged, delayed or lost each day by airline workers between 2019 and 2022.           The user who posted the TikTok video, Haeley Dyrdahl, said she recorded the incident Sunday at Miami International Airport “after I saw them do this and laugh with the first two wheelchairs.” She told CNN she also saw a suitcase get the same treatment.           In the video, as the first man lets the wheelchair go, a second baggage handler, who is on the ground at the other end of the chute and wearing an American Airlines vest, steps back. The wheelchair slides down, strikes the barrier and flips over. The handler then loads the wheelchair onto a baggage cart. It’s unclear if the wheelchair was damaged.           For those who use wheelchairs, arriving at an airport only to learn an essential tool for mobility has been damaged can be a real nightmare.     Air Canada issues apology and pledges to expedite accessibility improvements for passengers with disabilities         Dyrdahl told CNN she often works with wheelchair users through her job and has had many families “express concerns with how their wheelchair would be handled during travel.”           “After seeing this happen firsthand a couple times in a row, I was very sad to learn just how valid their concerns are,” she said.           American Airlines said in a statement, “We recognize how important it is to support the independence of customers with disabilities by ensuring the proper care of mobility devices throughout their journey with us. This visual is deeply concerning and we are gathering more details so that we can address them with our team. We will continue to work hard to improve our handling of assistive devices across our network.”           The airline said it is working to improve training for employees handling mobility devices and installing wheelchair movers and lifts at airports with high mobility device traffic, which will help lower the risk of damage. It did not provide a timeline.           In a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the incident was “totally unacceptable” and the department, which has published a bill of rights for disabled passengers, would investigate.           In August 2023, American Airlines mishandled 226 wheelchairs and scooters – a rate of 2.24 per 100 they handled on planes, according to the most recent available data released by the Department of Transportation. Among 15 major US carriers, it ranked 13th, according to the data.           The data is trending in the wrong direction for the airline. In 2022, American Airlines’ rate of damaging, delaying or losing wheelchairs and scooters was 2.00 per 100, DOT statistics show.     Future airplanes must meet stricter accessibility standards, but not for years         In September, the DOT announced United Airlines would “roll out a flight filter on its booking engine to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to find flights where their wheelchairs can fit and be safely transported” as part of an agreement with the department.           The DOT also said it was laying the groundwork for a potential policy that would give passengers the ability to stay in their wheelchairs on flights.           Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who uses a wheelchair, called the video “shocking, but not surprising based on my own travel experiences or those of anyone who relies on a mobility device to live their lives fully.”           “Since I passed a law requiring public disclosure of how often airlines damage mobility devices, data shows that far too many wheelchair users land at their destinations only to find their wheelchairs broken, often irreparably,” Duckworth said in a statement. “It’s completely unacceptable to treat critical medical devices like this.”           In 2018, Duckworth authored the bill that requires the DOT to issue monthly reports on damage to wheelchairs and scooters, and she is continuing to work on federal legislation to improve travel for disabled passengers.           In September, Duckworth and Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, introduced the Mobility Aids on Board Improve Lives and Empower All (MOBILE) Act to address challenges faced by passengers who use mobility aids.           “Though DOT is currently required to report the number of wheelchairs damaged each month, it does not evaluate data on the frequency or types of damage to manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs or scooters,” the statement from Duckworth and Thune -– both members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee -– said.     ‘Unbelievably excited’ - wheelchair users react to new Delta airplane seat design         The legislation would require the Secretary of Transportation to notify air carriers of proposed rulemaking that would require them to publish dimensions of cargo holds. It also calls on the agency to study whether it is possible for passengers to use wheelchairs in the main cabin.           It also says, “If in-flight, in-wheelchair seating is determined to be technically feasible, (the secretary should) assess the economic and financial feasibility of accommodating passengers with their wheelchairs in the main cabin during flight.”           Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, and Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican, introduced a similar bill in the House.

Among 15 major US carriers, it ranked 13th, according to the data.           The data is trending in the wrong direction for the airline. In 2022, American Airlines’ rate of damaging, delaying or losing wheelchairs and scooters was 2.00 per 100, DOT statistics show.     Future airplanes must meet stricter accessibility standards, but not for years         In September, the DOT announced United Airlines would “roll out a flight filter on its booking engine to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to find flights where their wheelchairs can fit and be safely transported” as part of an agreement with the department.           The DOT also said it was laying the groundwork for a potential policy that would give passengers the ability to stay in their wheelchairs on flights.           Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who uses a wheelchair, called the video “shocking, but not surprising based on my own travel experiences or those of anyone who relies on a mobility device to live their lives fully.”           “Since I passed a law requiring public disclosure of how often airlines damage mobility devices, data shows that far too many wheelchair users land at their destinations only to find their wheelchairs broken, often irreparably,” Duckworth said in a statement. “It’s completely unacceptable to treat critical medical devices like this.”           In 2018, Duckworth authored the bill that requires the DOT to issue monthly reports on damage to wheelchairs and scooters, and she is continuing to work on federal legislation to improve travel for disabled passengers.           In September, Duckworth and Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, introduced the Mobility Aids on Board Improve Lives and Empower All (MOBILE) Act to address challenges faced by passengers who use mobility aids.           “Though DOT is currently required to report the number of wheelchairs damaged each month, it does not evaluate data on the frequency or types of damage to manual wheelchairs, power wheelchairs or scooters,” the statement from Duckworth and Thune -– both members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee -– said.     ‘Unbelievably excited’ - wheelchair users react to new Delta airplane seat design         The legislation would require the Secretary of Transportation to notify air carriers of proposed rulemaking that would require them to publish dimensions of cargo holds. It also calls on the agency to study whether it is possible for passengers to use wheelchairs in the main cabin.           It also says, “If in-flight, in-wheelchair seating is determined to be technically feasible, (the secretary should) assess the economic and financial feasibility of accommodating passengers with their wheelchairs in the main cabin during flight.”           Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, and Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican, introduced a similar bill in the House.

world,The history of Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade: 5 facts you may not know,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-feat/index.html,"       As far as holiday traditions go, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is about as essential to the cozy November holiday as turkey and stuffing.           While it’s had some interruptions and mishaps along the way, the show has still managed to go on almost every year for nearly a century.           Let’s look back at five historical facts about the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade:           The original store was about 20 blocks south on Sixth Avenue near 14th Street. Macy’s has been at its current flagship location, at Broadway and 34th Street, since 1902. Continuing expansion made the location what Macy’s called the “world’s largest store,” an entire city block with more than 1 million square feet of retail space.            In celebration, employees organized a Christmas parade in 1924 featuring “floats, bands, animals from the zoo and 10,000 onlookers,” according to a Macy’s history page. It also started way up at 145th Street. The parade concluded with Santa Claus and the unveiling of the store’s Christmas windows. Three years later, the Christmas Parade was renamed the Thanksgiving Day Parade.           Macy’s didn’t invent the practice. Philadelphia has the oldest Thanksgiving Day parade: Its Gimbels Thanksgiving Day Parade, now the 6ABC - Dunkin’ Thanksgiving Day Parade, debuted in 1920.           You had to use your visual imagination when the first broadcasts of the parade took place in 1932 – that’s because they were on the radio.            The parade was first televised in 1946 in New York and then nationally on NBC the next year.            According to Mental Floss, the balloon attractions debuted in 1927, inspired by a balloon float. Even then, they were massive – one was a 60-foot dinosaur – and, in those days, they had more to deal with than just high winds and crazy weather: Until 1938, an elevated train ran down Sixth Avenue.           Well-known characters have been part of the parade since that 1927 outing. Felix the Cat was there from the beginning, and Mickey Mouse joined in 1934, the same year that featured a balloon based on popular entertainer Eddie Cantor. “Peanuts” characters, especially Snoopy – who made his first appearance in 1968 – are regular visitors.           One tradition didn’t last long. The balloons were originally allowed to float away, and those who found them got a gift certificate from Macy’s.            For years, the parade’s Midtown route went right down Broadway, Manhattan’s spine. But in 2009, the route was moved to Seventh Avenue because of new pedestrian plazas along Broadway. It was changed to Sixth Avenue in 2011. Given the parade’s draw as a tourist attraction, this did not go over well with some folks.           For 2019, the route started at 77th Street and Central Park West, where it took a left turn at 59th Street. It continued to ride past Central Park until it reached Sixth Avenue. From there, it headed down to 34th Street, where it hung a right and ended at the flagship store.            And because of the pandemic, 2020 saw a very shortened only-for-TV route near the flagship store.           You can check out the 2.5-mile route for 2023 on Macy’s website.           In 1957, a wet day got wetter for people near a Popeye balloon: The character’s hat filled with water and drenched parade watchers. The same thing happened in 1962 with a Donald Duck hat.           Superman once lost his arm to tree branches.            But the worst was probably 1997, a blustery day in the Big Apple. During that parade, winds reached more than 40 miles per hour, and the balloons were difficult to control. One balloon struck a lamppost and injured four people; one woman was in a coma for a month. The Pink Panther threatened a woman holding its ropes.           “The balloon was caught on top of me and my daughter,” she told The New York Times. “We thought it was going to smother us.”       CNN’s Forrest Brown contributed to this article.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,A cake in the shape of a diving platform wins the Pastry Grand Prix in Paris,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/grand-prix-pastry-paris/index.html,"       Displayed in a room overlooking the Seine that was filled with the smell of warm butter and baked flour, an opéra pastry in the form of a diving platform perched in a shiny, blue pool was awarded the best pastry of Paris title on Tuesday.           A panel of seven judges – including pastry chefs, industry representatives and everyday Parisians and led by legendary French pastry chef Pierre Hermé – presided over the competition.           Fittingly named “The Diving Opéra,” the winner of this year’s Pastry Grand Prix was created by Michelin-starred pastry chef Raamin Samiyi. Tourists and Parisians have flocked to the gourmet doughnut store Momzi, which Samiyi opened in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris.           “Thank you so much! My heart is beating so fast right now,” Samiyi said with a shaking voice as Hermé called him on spearkerphone to inform him of the result.           Hermé, who has his own renowned pastry shop and heads up making desserts for French state banquets (including the one held for King Charles’ recent visit to France), expressed his amazement at the fact that Samiyi is himself a swimmer and diver.           “My coach is actually going to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics,” Samiyi responded.           The theme of this year’s Grand Prix was “sporting values” as the French capital gears up to host the Olympic and Paralympic games next summer.           All pastry shops, bakeries, hotels and restaurants in Paris are eligible to participate in the competition. But each shop, chain or group can send only one candidate.           Among the other requirements, participants must use at least one ingredient either cultivated or produced in the French capital. The pastry submitted must also be conceptualized specifically for the Grand Prix and able to be produced and sold commercially in the participant’s shop.     He makes the best baguette in Paris, but he’s not from France         The 12 pastries that entered the final round represented many of the world’s favorite French pastries, including opéra, Saint-Honoré, éclair and lemon tarte.           The competing cakes were graded on five factors – taste, technique, creativity, ingredient quality and aesthetic – with each worth five points.           The four-hour long tasting and grading session unfolded in a light-hearted atmosphere.           When the first cake was served  – a lemon tarte with cheesecake filling called l’Olympia – two judges struggled for a while before writing down their notes.           “The first one is always difficult,” they laughed.           One pastry – in the form of a whistle, with coffee and chocolate filling – sparked the interest of Paris Deputy Mayor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, who was co-chair of the judging panel.           “Is it difficult to balance the taste of coffee and chocolate when put side-by-side in a cake?” Bonnet-Oulaldj asked the professionals at the table.           “It’s difficult, but it is really the basic of the basics for a pastry chef,” Hermé replied as others laughed.           For his win, Samiyi will receive 4,000 euros ($4,365) and win a seat on the judging panel of next year’s Grand Prix.           Whether Samiyi will put his winning diving platform opéra on sale in his store is up to him, the Paris mayor’s office told CNN.           For those with a sweet tooth visiting Paris this Christmas and next year, keep an eye out for a sweet diving pool — you don’t want to miss the best pastry in Paris.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Edward Berthelot/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/style/thai-celebrities-boys-love-fashion-brands/index.html," Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.   (CNN) — Back in February, Nattawin Wattanagitiphat’s fans spared no expense in marking the Thai actor’s 29th birthday. Videos that made their way onto social media showed ‘Apo,’ as he is affectionately known, wading through a sea of flower bouquet stands, multiple cakes towering over six feet tall, gold bars, cash and even a Rolex watch all gifted by his fan base. Local media reported his birthday haul totaled 50 million Thai baht, or around $1.4 million.           With such an army of intense supporters behind him, it’s little wonder then that Apo was named by Christian Dior as a men’s ambassador this summer, along with his co-star Phakphum ‘Mile’ Romsaithong. The two actors, who star as an on-screen couple in a BL television series (a “boys’ love” drama featuring gay romance themes) called “KinnPorsche,” have become a valuable marketing vehicle for the brand. The pair have appeared at events across Asia, including Dior’s show in India, and on the covers of various editions of Vogue, GQ and other magazines.           One reason they provide a good return on investment is the remarkably high engagement they generate on social media. Data from a report released by Lefty.io, a social media analytics company, and public relations firm Karla Otto found that Apo and Mile were ranked 3rd and 5th in earned media value for the Spring-Summer 2024 show season on Instagram and TikTok — only after Kylie Jenner and Zendaya, who have 399 million and 185 million followers respectively on Instagram. In comparison, the Thai actors have just 3.5 million Instagram followers each. Still, they are able to induce a fanaticism that’s typically only seen with South Korean stars.           But Apo and Mile are not the only Thai celebrities gaining traction as brand ambassadors, campaign models and fashion muses. The country has emerged as a hotspot for talent, with Dior adding yet another Thai ambassador this month, actress Tontawan Tantivejakul.           Dior would not be drawn on its decision to focus on Thai celebrities, instead describing the three ambassadors in a statement as “exceptional personalities who are always singular, audacious, virtuosos of their fields, symbolizing the zeitgeist.”           But the growing popularity of ambassadors from Thailand is no doubt underpinned by the country’s status as a key emerging market for luxury brands, and its role as a cultural, economic and tourism hub not only for Southeast Asia but the wider Asia-Pacific region. Famously welcoming to foreigners, its capital Bangkok frequently ranks as the most visited city in the world according to the Mastercard Index.  And the Thai luxury market is “leading growth” in Southeast Asia, according to a report released this month by consultancy Bain & Company.           Thailand’s biggest global star is arguably musician Lalisa Manobal from the K-pop girl group Blackpink. Better known as Lisa, the Celine and Bulgari ambassador has 99 million followers on Instagram. There’s also Bambam (real name Kunpimook Bhuwakul) who followed the K-pop trajectory to fame as part of the now defunct boyband GOT7. He has appeared in YSL Beauty ads and, more recently, attended Pharrell Williams’ debut Louis Vuitton show.           But more often than not, the Thai stars who are able to build international fan bases tend to be actors. Davika Hoorne, who starred in Pee Mak, Thailand’s highest grossing film of all time, was named Gucci’s first global brand ambassador from the country last year. Urassaya Sperbund, the Thai-Norwegian actress and model who starred in a Louis Vuitton watch campaign in 2019, rose to international acclaim earlier thanks to a feature in American Vogue.     ‘Boys Love’ genre finds new audiences in South Korea         Some of the actors generating the biggest buzz are male celebrities, more specifically those appearing in gay romance plotlines. This summer, ‘Bright’ (Vachirawit Chivaaree), who starred in the popular show “2gether: The Series” was unveiled by Calvin Klein as its new face, on the heels of a Burberry brand ambassadorship. Bright’s co-star on the show, Metawin ‘Win’ Opas-Iamkajorn , has also made a big impact, signing on with Prada at the start of this year.           The celebrity endorsement market has evolved into a large enough opportunity that former Vogue Thailand editor Nichapat Suphap this month launched Venture Management, an agency representing leading Thai stars overseas. Starting with six names, in addition to Apo, Mile and Bright, Suphap’s firm manages Wichapas ‘Bible’ Sumettikul, another actor from “KinnPorsche” who starred in a Ralph Lauren fragrance advertisement this year, and actor Kanawut ‘Gulf’ Traipipattanapong, who has appeared at events for Gucci.           Currently, Suphap says she’s negotiating deals with luxury watch, luggage and camera brands for her array of celebrities. It’s a far cry from just a few years ago when Thai figures were relegated to the sidelines. “We were not the priority when attending events abroad,” she said. “(Thais) got the leftover looks from western celebrities.”           “But now things have changed. Fashion shows shed more spotlight on Thai talents (so) we get custom looks (as) we become more the center of attention, because of the number of fans waiting outside the shows and the amount of online engagement brands get,” Suphap explained.           According to data from Launchmetrics, the latest S/S 2024 Christian Dior womenswear show in Paris saw Apo and Mile garner $6 million in media impact value (MIV) each. That puts them nearly on par with Korean musician Jisoo from Blackpink, who generated a MIV of $6.5 million, but ahead of western stars Jennifer Lawrence ($4.5 million), Rosalía ($3.7 million) and Robert Pattinson ($2.7 million).           Fatti Laleh, Piaget’s global communications and image director, said she witnessed the fandom for Apo, who she later signed as a friend for the watch and jewelry house, first hand.           “He walked with me outside of this five-star hotel during fashion week and I was amazed to see with my own eyes the magnitude of the people that were cheering for him and waiting for him,” Laleh said, adding that many of the fans gathered were European, demonstrating a degree of global appeal. “Beyond the cultural capital, his beauty and aesthetics, it’s what he reaches in media for us.”           Although that kind of loyalty may bear a resemblance to the K-pop stars well entrenched within the fashion industry, there are differences to working with Thai talent. Because the Thai entertainment industry is not yet as structured or strictly managed as Korea’s, agencies take a more relatable approach to partnerships, suggests Krisda Witthayakhajorndet, the director of “KinnPorsche.”           “Thais are humble and fun,” he said. “Off-screen, I let my actors be themselves… (They’re) not perfect idols. I think the audiences can feel that… I think people are looking for something that’s not that perfect anymore.”           Venture Management’s Suphap agrees. “K-pop stars dedicated their lives training (from a young age) to be idols,” but Thai stars, she said, can be more relaxed. For example, they often manage to attend a regular school even while building their public profile.           “Of course, we still want to keep them exclusive, but I would say we are more friendly with the fans,” she said. “We say hi to them, we take pictures with some. We don’t really keep the talent in a box like Korean companies do.”     This Norwegian couple’s playful, gender-defying portraits were discovered by chance, decades after their deaths         Another advantage some Thai celebrities have is their ability to resonate among Chinese audiences. While South Korean celebrities are often still not allowed major exposure  in the country because of political tensions between the two nations, Thais experience no such issue. Moreover, fourteen percent of Thailand’s population are ethnic Chinese — and the number is much higher for those of mixed Chinese-Thai heritage.           The biggest obstacle to Thai celebrities becoming even more of a worldwide phenomenon, Suphap said, is something they share with other nationalities across the region: a language barrier.           Generally, “they can understand and converse in English of course,” said. “But to give an interview can be a challenge because we can’t express our in-depth knowledge in a matter of seconds. English is definitely the biggest challenge right now.”     This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

world,These portraits show young people who are proud to be Native — even if others don’t see them that way,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/style/lumbee-you-dont-look-native-maria-sturm-hyphenated-cec/index.html," Editor’s Note: This feature is part of CNN Style’s series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.         The people of Pembroke, North Carolina, don’t shy away from their Native identity.           In fact, some of them wear it on their sleeves — be it a feather-patterned blanket draped around the shoulders or a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Native Pride.”           These kinds of markers are everywhere in Pembroke, the tribal seat of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, and surrounding Robeson County, photographer Maria Sturm said. But when members of this 55,000-strong tribe venture outside their tight-knit community, they’re often told they don’t “look” Native.           That tension is at the heart of Sturm’s latest photography book “You Don’t Look Native To Me.”           Through tender portraits of young Lumbee people, combined with snippets of interview transcripts and historical text, Sturm explores what makes someone Native American. Is it race, tribal citizenship or a community you’re a part of? Who gets to decide? And what do you do when outsiders — the US government and even other tribes — don’t see you the way you see yourselves?           “It is more the way you carry yourself, and it doesn’t really matter the shade that you have,” Sturm said in a Zoom interview. “The shade that you have matters in an outside world more than it mattered in that microcosm of Robeson County.”           Questions of identity and belonging loom large for the Lumbee, the most populous tribe east of the Mississippi River.           Though the state of North Carolina recognized the tribe in 1885 and Congress in 1956 acknowledged the Lumbee as American Indians, the federal government also denied them the rights and funding afforded to other federally recognized tribes. To this day, the Lumbee tribe continues to fight for full federal recognition.           The tribe’s in-between status is a product of its history. The Lumbee have roots in various Sioux, Algonquin and Iroquois-speaking nations who migrated to modern-day Robeson County after fleeing disease, the slave trade and warfare brought on by European colonization, as historian Malinda Maynor Lowery documents in “The Lumbee Indians: An American Struggle.” Some of the Natives eventually intermarried with English-speaking settlers, as well as enslaved and free African Americans, resulting in a mixed population with a wide array of physical features.           Descendants of these groups make up the community now known as the Lumbee. Even as their culture and traditions evolved over time, and as others question their status as American Indians, the Lumbee maintained an identity as Native people.           And as Sturm captures in her photos, many young Lumbee are figuring out for themselves what that identity and culture looks like.           Sturm, who is Romanian and grew up in Germany, started photographing the Lumbee in 2011.           The project was born out of a conversation with her stepfather, who told her about his friend Jay Hansford C. Vest — a member of the Monacan Indian Nation, which at the time was unrecognized by the federal government.           Sturm kept stumbling over the word “unrecognized.” She couldn’t wrap her head around the concept: How could a non-Native entity determine whether a tribe was Native American or not? What did that even mean?           Sturm said her stepfather also mentioned that Vest had blue eyes and blond hair — a detail that prompted her to confront her own internalized notions and stereotypes about Native Americans.           “In that moment, I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I have never met a Native American person in my life. Why can he not be blond and have blue eyes?’” she said.           Sturm visited Vest at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, where he was teaching at the time, and sat in on his classes. Thinking she would explore the issue of unrecognized tribes, she asked Vest’s students if anyone might be able to take her around their community.           That’s when she encountered Jonathan Jacobs, a Lumbee man whose musings about Lumbee culture and identity are featured prominently through the book. Through Jacobs, Sturm said she was introduced to other Lumbee and the project grew from there.           Over the course of several visits between 2011 and 2017, Sturm documented the lives of the Lumbee, gravitating toward how young people understood their identity and how they chose to telegraph that to the world.           “With the rise of social media, there was a new way of being proud of identifying yourself as Native American whereas before it wasn’t always possible,” Sturm said.           As Sturm observed, that identity is signaled, in part, through the heavily present Native symbolism. Pembroke “screams of Native American things,” she added. It’s in the roads named “Lumbee Street” and “Dreamcatcher Drive,” in the dreamcatchers hanging on the walls of homes, on cars and in tattoos. In these symbols, Sturm picked up on an implicit message.           “For me, it’s a little bit like, ‘Don’t ask me. Maybe I don’t look that way, but it’s clear. We don’t have to have this discussion,’” Sturm said.           Some might even perceive it as stereotypical — in one photo, a Lumbee man named Scottie wears a Washington Redskins jacket containing a logo that is now widely considered offensive. When Sturm asked him about it, she said he told her “this is who I am.”           “It shows that you know you are something. And because everything is stripped away … you have just these little bits and pieces that you can hold onto,” Sturm said. “I thought it’s pretty impressive that the symbols that a person like Scottie holds onto are not even original, but in a way they give him so much pride and confidence.”           Throughout the book, Sturm’s subjects reflect on their personal struggles around their identity.           Kayla tells Strum about how her grandmother raised her as Lumbee, but at the same time didn’t take her to powwows and discouraged her from speaking the Lumbee dialect. As a result, she was picked on for “talking like a White girl” at home, yet is considered a “country bumpkin” when she goes elsewhere.           Jacobs, meanwhile, pushes back on the idea that the Lumbee even need federal recognition. Even though certain aspects of their culture have been lost or changed over time, he knows he is Lumbee, as do others in the community. For him, it’s all that matters.           “I’m like a billion percent sure we will never know what Lumbee language was. I’m a billion percent sure we will never know really where we came from. But that does not mean we are not Indian,” Jacobs says in the book.           It’s this sense of self-determination that has stuck with Sturm. She hopes the project will resonate with anyone who has ever had their identity questioned.           “I hope at least that many people can relate to this feeling of wanting or belonging to something, but other people are not able to see that about you,” Sturm said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Capturing the wild days of early-2000s indie rock,https://edition.cnn.com/style/2000s-indie-rock-indie-seen-book/index.html,"       If you were a teen at the turn of the millennium, chances are your musical taste fell into one of two camps: You were either a pop kid, with the likes of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, *NSYNC or Destiny’s Child on your Sony Discman, or you were a “new indie rock” kid with posters of Pete Doherty or The Strokes’ Julian Casablancas on your bedroom walls.           The latter genre was loosely defined. Indie rock acts ranged in style and sound. The Libertines, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Modest Mouse and Amy Winehouse might all be considered part of the movement, albeit in very different ways. What they shared, though, was an aura of cool — one that Los Angeles-based photographer Piper Ferguson spent much of her early career capturing.           Ferguson’s debut book “Indie, Seen” offers a raw and nostalgic look at the early-2000s, with behind-the-scenes portraits depicting artists from Interpol to Kasabian, Peaches to PJ Harvey. Together they form what she described as “a collection of ‘moments’ that really capture what indie was all about back then.”           “I have so much footage from those days,” she said over Zoom. “To me, it was such a fantastic, creative era for the music industry.”           Comprising some 350 images, many of which spent years languishing in filing cabinets, “Indie, Seen” features live shots and party pictures, candid snapshots and editorial portraits, all shot using film. Many were taken at Ferguson’s own LA club Cafe Bleu, which she opened with best friend Shalyce Benfell in the late 1990s, while later pictures were captured as she traveled the world to photograph festivals for magazines.           “I have always been into music — so much so that I originally wanted to direct music videos. Photography didn’t really seem like a career option. Then I bought a small Pentax (camera) and began shooting all the bands that played at Cafe Bleu,” Ferguson said, explaining that she learned her craft from photography books purchased at a yard sale. “I started taking the camera with me everywhere I went, just snapping gigs, the crowds, the backstage. And I fell in love with it.”     In photos: The queer ‘renegades’ who built community in 1990s San Francisco         In 1999, Ferguson had a picture — a close-up shot of Rage Against the Machine performing at the very first edition of Coachella — published in a major music publication, Spin, for the first time. More magazine work, from features to covers, followed. Over the next decade, she established herself as a respected name in the indie circuit and, at the time, one of its very few female photographers.           “It was obviously a bit different being a woman in a very male-dominated field,” Ferguson said. “But overall, there were way more people who were supportive than weren’t. I think that’s one of the things that made the indie movement particularly great: There was a collective sense of wanting to do something really cool and help others doing the same. I was treated like a peer, an equal. Everybody was just striving to make something good.”           This camaraderie is evident throughout “Indie, Seen,” which sees Ferguson weave together photos with personal, first-hand accounts and vignettes of her experience shooting them.           There’s Joe Strummer of The Clash telling her “You can’t rush art, baby” as she apologizes for a shoot taking too long (“one of the greatest moments of my career,” Ferguson said of the playful comment); The Verve front man Richard Ashcroft driving her through a London park in search of the perfect backdrop for a picture; and The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr (who wrote the foreword to her book) becoming a good friend of hers after working on several shoots together.           “Mostly, everyone was just really laidback and fun,” Ferguson said. “And a bit wild, of course.”           Sections of the book are dedicated to episodes that felt like particularly meaningful cultural moments — The Strokes playing at West Hollywood’s Troubadour in 2001, the year the band’s debut album “Is This It” sealed indie rock as the next chapter of rock ‘n’ roll; or Coldplay performing at LA’s Chateau Marmont in 2002 shortly after the release of “A Rush of Blood to the Head.”           “I realized I was witnessing history and tried to take in each and every shoot,” she said.     How Afrobeats conquered the world: One photographer documents the rise of a musical phenomenon         Ferguson also delves into quieter moments with seminal bands like The Killers, Pavement, Interpol and The Libertines. While she said all the shoots felt special, her favorites include a raw on-stage image of the late Amy Winehouse putting on a ballet slipper while balancing on the other foot.           “She looked so nervous and was shaking, as if she had no idea why the crowd was going crazy for her,” Ferguson recalled, adding that the late singer looked “so vulnerable.”           Then there’s the photo of Beck in a bright green jumper and floral tie, umbrella in hand, looking directly down Ferguson’s lens outside a taco joint in Hollywood. The image, from a Mojo magazine shoot marking the release of his 2005 album “Guero,” graces the cover of Ferguson’s book.           “He’s the coolest, most down-to-earth creative kid in town,” she said, “and the epitome of indie rock.”           As well as capturing era-defining bands, “Indie, Seen” spotlights some of the 2000s’ lesser-known — but nonetheless influential — bands like The Datsuns, Foxygen and The Bangs. For Ferguson, illustrating the breadth of the movement was key to curating the book.           “When I think of indie music from the early aughts, I think of something inherently different, artistic and creative,” she said. “So many bands were part of that, and I thought it was important to show them all. The scene was so wide-ranging.”           This might be one of the reasons why the genre thrived in the 2000s, despite being considered “alternative.” Eschewing strict categorizations, indie rock ranged from the catchy and high-energy tunes of The Cribs to the deeply intimate and introspective songs of Cat Power, from Death Cab for Cutie’s atmospheric albums to the folksy vibes of Iron & Wine, all artists Ferguson had the opportunity to photograph. Indie music had what Ferguson called an “almost DIY approach” that, she noted, made it feel authentic and open to experimentation.           The genre became the decade’s soundtrack for a generation of millennials – and some Gen X-ers, too. Still, Ferguson hopes the appeal of “Indie, Seen” extends beyond those who grew up in the 2000s.     Behind the scenes of Tupac’s iconic photoshoot         “I’d love for younger generations to pick up the book and go, ‘Let me go find this or that band on Spotify,’” she said. “Indie rock marks a pretty influential period of our music history, so I’d really like for it to continue to reverberate. I want ‘Indie, Seen’ to be a celebration. An invitation to be inspired by those cool kids from back then. Try things. Don’t be afraid. Get out there. That’s the indie spirit.”     “Indie, Seen,” published by Insight Editions, is available now.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,Is this Banksy’s real name? Resurfaced interview suggests it could be,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/style/banksy-real-name-resurfaced-interview-intl-scli/index.html,"       Anonymity lies at the center of the mythology surrounding the elusive street artist Banksy, but he may have revealed his name in a resurfaced interview.           First recorded in 2003, the interview was released Tuesday as a bonus episode of the BBC podcast series “The Banksy Story.”         When former BBC arts correspondent Nigel Wrench asked Banksy whether his name was “Robert Banks,” as The Independent newspaper had reported at the time, the artist responded: “It’s Robbie.”           Wrench shared the archival interview with podcast host James Peak, a self-confessed “super fan” of Banksy’s work, after hearing the 10-episode series that had charted the artist’s rise and included an unverified recording of his voice from a recovered 2005 interview with US National Public Radio (NPR).           However, all might not be as it seems, as is so often the case with Banksy – an artist known for his satirical humor, subversive methods and anti-authority themes.           “A name comes out,” Peak told CNN Tuesday. “Is it the right name? Is it a clever joke?” Peak added, alluding to the fact that a name like Robbie Banks could be a good pun.           Shielded by his anonymity, Banksy’s distinctive graffiti art has popped up around the world, appearing on the walls of bombed buildings in Ukraine, on T-shirts to support protesters facing trial for toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston during 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in England, and in Paris, highlighting Europe’s migrant crisis in 2018.           His 2003 show, which opened shortly after his interview with Wrench, featured graffitied police vans, an image of Winston Churchill with a grass Mohican and live farm animals painted with the Metropolitan Police’s blue-checked patterns.           Banksy talks about these political themes within his work with Wrench, revealing the “kernel” of his early ideas before he became a global icon, as he considered the merits of using graffiti as a means to produce art, Peak said.           “If you are a guy making art that sells for ridiculous sums of money and you have this… administration around you, I have often wondered how pure you can be in your intention and art,” Peak added.           “And what strikes me listening to this interview is all that is present and correct… it’s almost like he’s made up his mind about… what his art is for and the means of engagement for it.”           Despite these political themes that have marked his work from early on, Banksy told Wrench in 2003 that he didn’t consider himself to be “that political.”           He added: “If you think about anything about your life for longer than a second, then you have to work out that the shoes you wear are made by somebody on a pathetic amount of money and the coffee you drink means somebody, somewhere in the world is getting done over.”     Is this what Banksy sounds like? Old interview may hold the key         Speaking about vandalism and his approach to art, Banksy said: “[Vandalism] is a quicker way of making your point.”           “For me, the golden aim really is… it takes you less time to make it than it takes for people to look at it,” he added.           Asked whether his exhibition was about anarchism, Banksy told Wrench: “I’m interested in injustice. Who has the right to judge anybody else? If you’ve ever fallen foul of the justice system then it turns you very skeptical about everything, so I guess I like to turn it on its head a little bit… I’m into working out who really is the good guys.”           Listening to the archival interview has only increased his admiration of Banksy, Peak said, an admiration that grew from realizing the artistic “brilliance” but also the “warm and human and kind and progressive and liberal… sentiments” underpinning it.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,The shoe with staying power: Louboutin’s red sole turns 30,https://edition.cnn.com/style/christian-louboutin-red-bottom-soles/index.html,"       When it comes to footwear, there are few signifiers more iconic or more aspirational than Christian Louboutin’s red sole.           In the 30 years since its inception, the brand has perhaps done more than any other to transform a piece of footwear into an objet d’art — the design of their heels intended to accentuate the curvature of the foot, the flicker of the red sole almost a naughty wink as the wearer walks away.           Worn by the showgirls of the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris and on the catwalks of high-end fashion houses, Pamela Anderson, Lady Gaga and Blake Lively are among Louboutin’s many celebrity fans.           “My wardrobe is brimming with Louboutins — the classic black Pigalle stiletto in patent or matte black leather is my go-to shoe,” supermodel Kate Moss told British Vogue in 2014. “I have so many pairs that Christian designed a style with a sharper toe and nail-thin heel, which he named the ‘So Kate.’”           “Loubis” have appeared in countless television series and movies too— Carrie Bradshaw famously wore a mismatched pair while vacationing in Los Angeles during an episode of “Sex and the City,” while a custom pair were designed for Miss Piggy in the 2011 film “The Muppets.” Taylor Swift wore crystal-encrusted versions on her Eras tour and Beyoncé has worn the red-soled shoe at Coachella. The brand has even had a shoutout from Cardi B in her chart-topping single “Bodak Yellow.”           “I call Mr. Louboutin the greatest showman in footwear,” Footwear News style director Shannon Adducci told CNN Style. “To fans, the red sole equals the height of glamor.”           The red soles’ origin story is the stuff of fashion folklore: In 1993, two years after launching his independent business, Louboutin designed a shoe collection inspired by Andy Warhol’s “Flowers” lithograph. The prototype came back featuring a floral motif on a pink stacked heel, but the design didn’t “pop” like Louboutin had hoped. After seeing his assistant painting her nails, the designer had an “aha” moment and took red nail varnish to paint the sole instead.           “The color red is a representation of love, passion and life,” Louboutin told CNN Style via email. “It’s strong, noticeable, powerful, and known for attracting good fortune.”           The Louboutin aesthetic is both decadent and daring — part Marie Antoinette and part femme fatale. Handcrafted in Italy, the brand’s shoes created not only in leather but using crystal, feathers and even velvet studded with silver strass (similar to rhinestone).     A woman with the ‘it’ factor: The enduring appeal of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy         But they aren’t for the faint of heart. While they may be highly crafted, they’re also highly priced, costing from around $350 for a pair of Louboutin rubber flip flops to almost $4,000 for thigh-high metallic leather boots. All come with the red sole.           They’re also vertiginous, with pumps rising to a heel height of 120mm (4.7in) for that much-admired but notoriously hard-to-walk-in style, the “So Kate.” In platforms, heels soar higher still — the “Maria Frou Alta” measures 160mm (6.5in).           “A good shoe is a shoe which makes you feel good, look good, feel confident, engaged, and fierce,” Louboutin told CNN. “A good shoe is the one which brings you joy when you think about it and when you wear it. They transform your body language and attitude. They lift you physically and emotionally. Just like the glass slipper (from Cinderella) makes people dream, I try to make my shoes create the same effect, to allow you to be whatever character you dream to be.”           Just don’t expect them to always be comfortable.           In an interview with British Vogue in 2012, Louboutin said: “People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don’t want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable. I try to make high heels as comfortable as they can be, but my priority is design, beauty and sexiness.”           Nevertheless, Louboutin has proven they play a strong game and are here for the long haul, even weathering the global loungewear and slippers era that was the pandemic. Earlier this year, a spokesperson for the brand told CNN that: “The popularity of heels remained robust during and after the lockdown period,” while acknowledging that “the pandemic did prompt an appetite for a large range of heeled styles reflecting the change in lifestyle and trends (including) platforms, low and block heels.”     Have we said goodbye to high heels?         In recent years, the brand has increased its offering of flats and trainers — with a Louboutin twist. Sneakers range from elegant white tennis shoes with a red trim and sole, to statement-making chunky leather lug sole treads with stud detailing.           But flats haven’t been the only diversification for a brand known for its heels. As well as handbags, kids’ shoes and pet accessories, the house now has a beauty division featuring nail varnishes, lipstick and fragrances all referencing both the red sole and the silhouette of Louboutin’s signature pencil-thin heel. With prices from $60 for a lipstick, it’s still a luxury price point, but it brings a piece of the Louboutin magic a little more within reach.           In 2011, men’s footwear burst onto the scene too, bringing the red-bottomed shoes to a whole new (but still financially well-heeled) demographic. From calfskin moccasins with tassel detailing or trompe l’oeil embroidery to slip-on Venetian-style loafers covered in tartan or spikes, the designs were so successful that in 2012, Christian Louboutin opened its first men’s store in Paris. The collection now includes leopard print ankle boots with a 70mm block heel, lug sole sneakers adorned with spikes and patent lace-ups with rhinestone heels.           “He brought glamor to men’s footwear and made it okay to make a statement and show off a bit,” Adducci said.           Be they men’s or women’s, it’s the soles that most obviously set Louboutins apart from the pack. So when the shoes start to lose their distinctive-hued underneath — which does happen with wear — the brand can step in. Louboutin has company-approved cobblers permitted to restore shoes to their former glory using the house’s closely guarded and much protected signature shade — Pantone 18, also known as “Chinese Red.”           Perhaps naturally with something so successful,Indeed, the brand has fought hard to protect itself from other companies trying to benefit from a touch of its red magic. So integral have the soles become to the brand’s DNA that, in 2008, the fashion house applied for — and were granted — a trademark by the US Patent and Trademark Office for what their red soles. Since this trademarking, Louboutin has engaged in multiple complex trademark infringement court cases around the world with brands as diverse as high street retailer Zara and affordable Dutch shoe brand Van Haren to luxury French fashion house YSL — with mixed results.           One thing’s for sure, Louboutin fans are brand loyal — even, seemingly, the famous ones. “I once turned down a well-paying ad campaign for a major luxury shoe brand because I have such loyalty to (Christian) both as a designer and friend,” burlesque queen Dita Von Teese told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “I think Christian is the best shoe designer in the world.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

Snow will accumulate in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire.           Thanksgiving Day will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. A storm will begin to build over the northern Rockies on Thursday and strengthen on Friday bringing snow to portions of the Rockies, including Denver and Salt Lake City.

world,"Several tornadoes reported as dangerous storms fire up, threatening 20 million from Texas to the Southeast",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/weather/south-severe-storms-tornadoes-monday/index.html,"       Dangerous thunderstorms rumbled to life across parts of the South on Monday as more than 20 million people from eastern Texas to the Southeast faced a threat of damaging winds, hail and potentially strong tornadoes.           The severe thunderstorms moved across eastern Texas and the Mississippi Valley, bringing at least six reports of high winds, including gusts in Copiah County, Mississippi, estimated at more than 60 mph.           “A storm system will move from the southern Plains to the Northeast U.S. through Wednesday with severe thunderstorms for the northern Gulf states, gusty winds and heavy rain for the Southeast, and a wintry mix for the interior Northeast,” the National Weather Service said.     Tornado watches were in effect Monday night for more than 2.5 million people – mostly in Mississippi – as dangerous storms sprung to life. There were four reports of tornadoes in the state as of 8:15 p.m. CT, following one reported twister earlier in neighboring Louisiana.           An enhanced risk level for severe storms, or a Level 3 of 5, was in effect Monday night for parts of eastern Louisiana and central Mississippi, including Hattiesburg, Mississippi, the Storm Prediction Center said. The greatest risk for strong tornadoes that could deliver wind speeds over 111 mph – EF2-strength or stronger – remained possible across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley, the center said.           Level 1 and 2 severe threats were in place from Texas to Alabama and Arkansas, including Houston and Little Rock, Arkansas.           Tornado warnings hadn’t been issued across much of the Southeast since late June, but that changed Monday afternoon. November marks the start of a secondary severe weather season in the region. The clash of cold, Canadian air drilling into the South and lingering warm, moist air over the Gulf of Mexico typically leads to an uptick in damaging thunderstorms from November to December.           The storms may bring a brief reprieve to drought-stricken Louisiana and Mississippi, which could see excessive rainfall of up to 2 inches on Monday, and as many as 3 inches in some areas, according to the Weather Prediction Center.           Louisiana is suffering through its worst drought on record – one that’s fed unprecedented wildfires and contributed to the potentially catastrophic intrusion of saltwater into the Mississippi River. Exceptional drought – the US Drought Monitor’s most extreme category – now covers nearly three-quarters of the state, according to data released last week. In neighboring Mississippi, exceptional drought has spread over more than half of the state.           The same storm delivering severe thunderstorms to the South blew through the Rockies over the weekend, leaving heavy mountain snowfall piled nearly a foot high in several parts of Utah, Nevada and Colorado, preliminary snow reports show.           Parts of Utah saw a foot or more of snow, followed closely by some cities in Nevada.           Here are some of the latest preliminary snowfall totals reported by the National Weather Service:           Lower elevations were still warm enough to receive rainfall, with storm totals of 1 to 3 inches reported and isolated totals exceeding 3 inches.           High wind gusts also swept the region, with a gust of 144 mph reported in Mammoth, California, which has an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,"Significant Thanksgiving-week storm will disrupt travel with rain, snow and severe storms",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/weather/thanksgiving-travel-forecast-rain-snow/index.html,"       A significant storm will deal a blow to Thanksgiving travel this week, with rain, snow and even severe thunderstorms set to impact a large portion of the US.           This week is expected to be the busiest in years on the roads and airports could set new records – meaning this week’s headache-inducing weather could not come at a worse time.           The havoc-wreaking system will track from the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley on Monday and spread rain across much of the central US. Fortunately for any early week travelers, this rain is not expected to be heavy in most areas.     20 million from Texas to the Southeast at risk of severe storms and tornadoes         But a different threat has emerged and could snarl travel for portions of the Gulf Coast late Monday afternoon as the storm moves east: severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes. Severe weather, while more common in the spring, can happen any time of the year if there’s enough warmth and moisture in the air.           Damaging thunderstorms fired up Monday afternoon in east Texas, where the atmosphere is primed with plenty of moisture and warmth. These storms will track across Louisiana, Arkansas and push into Mississippi from Monday evening into early Tuesday morning.           Damaging winds and hail are likely within any of Monday’s severe thunderstorms. Several tornadoes are also possible, especially across Louisiana and Mississippi.           A fresh input of atmospheric energy and a robust surge of moisture will charge up the storm’s impacts Tuesday and usher in the most widespread, impactful weather of the week.           The issues will start early Tuesday morning in the Southeast, where the severe thunderstorm threat will be highest in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Storms could unload damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado.           Rain will expand east throughout Tuesday and spread into parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, where it will fall heavily at times. This heavy rainfall is unlikely to result in widespread flooding, but may pond on some roadways or in low-lying areas.           Breezy conditions will develop across the East on Tuesday, especially in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The combination of gusty winds and drenching rain may lead to disruptions in airport operations for large hubs in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC.           Wintry weather will present another challenge for holiday travelers in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday. Rain will mix with sleet and snow when precipitation begins across the elevated terrain of Pennsylvania Tuesday morning and southern New York by Tuesday afternoon.           This wintry mix will expand into parts of Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening and turn mostly to snow in some areas Tuesday night.           Accumulating snow Tuesday night will largely be confined to the highest elevations of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains.           Weather travel disruptions may not be as widespread on Wednesday as the storm slowly tracks off the East Coast and inland impacts start to diminish.          Roadways may be slick or snow-covered in parts of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Wednesday morning following Tuesday night’s wintry weather. More accumulating snow will arrive in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire.           Rain will taper off throughout the day across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and much of New York, but will persist across the Carolinas and parts of the Southeast.           For travelers across the West, the weather will be perfect for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday with high pressure in control across almost the entire region.           Thanksgiving will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. However, this influx of cold air will cause lake-effect snow showers to develop downwind of the Great Lakes.     Gas prices are tumbling, just in time for Thanksgiving         Dry weather is expected for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City on Thursday morning, but some breezy conditions may persist. The parade’s famous balloons are typically flown closer to the ground on a breezy day and higher off the ground on a calm day.           Elsewhere, a few rain showers may push across coastal Texas while in the West some mountain snow could bring fresh powder to high elevations in the northern Rockies.           Weather conditions will generally be calmer for travelers across the eastern half of the US heading home after Thanksgiving festivities on Friday, but the weekend may not be dry.           Another storm may develop and move off the East Coast over the weekend. Rain and potential wintry weather is possible across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. It’s still too early to know exactly how, or even if, this storm develops, but details will come into focus by midweek.           Travelers in the West should be treated another stretch of favorable conditions as high pressure remains in place.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Snow and rain to bring weather woes to millions of Thanksgiving travelers,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/weather/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-travel/index.html,"       Multiple storm systems could impact Thanksgiving travelers.           Two separate systems will impact holiday travelers Saturday – one in New England and the other along the West Coast – both bringing rain and snow and the possibility of travel delays.           The system in the East will push rain and gusty winds into coastal New England and some snow showers across the White and Green Mountains.           If you have travel flexibility, and are driving instead of flying, it may be best to wait until Sunday for most of New England. Travelers in and out of Boston will likely encounter rain showers, patchy fog and wind gusts up to 30 mph Saturday. By Sunday, the sunshine will return and winds will decrease to 10 to 20 mph.           The West Coast system will begin Saturday in the Portland, Oregon, area and will stretch down through San Diego.           Rain will also spread into desert cities, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque – and will continue Sunday from Seattle down through Eureka, California.           More than 6 million people from Southern California to southern Idaho are under wind advisories through Sunday. Winds could reach 40 to 50 mph with gusts as high as 60 mph in the mountains.           “Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles and motorcycles,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said. “Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and a few power outages may result.”           Sunday also will see a shift eastward for this system into the Mountain West and Central Plains.           Rain, and snow for higher elevations, will stretch from Washington to Colorado. Salt Lake City will see rain showers to start, but as temperatures drop Sunday evening, it will gradually change over to a mix of rain and snow.           The focus across the Central Plains will be rain and thunderstorms from Nebraska down through Texas.           By Monday, a new threat begins across the Gulf Coast with the possibility for tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds.           As this low pressure system deepens and advances eastward, it will also spread rain from Minnesota through Louisiana.           Rain chances increase through the day Monday in Shreveport, with thunderstorms developing in the late afternoon and continuing through the evening.           The day with the most weather-related headaches for travelers is likely to be Tuesday, with th﻿e low pressure system bringing rain and thunderstorms to the majority of the eastern half of the country.           The area looking at possible rain includes major airport cities – New York, Washington, Chicago, and Atlanta. All could see delays and frustrations from the wet forecast.           Atlanta could see over an inch of rain in less than 24 hours Tuesday, and winds could gust up to or over 30 mph all day, even though the thunderstorms will be mostly confined to the afternoon.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Chainwit./Wikimedia Commons,https://edition.cnn.com/style/thailand-robot-building-renovation-bangkok/index.html,"       For almost four decades, its cartoonish eyes gazed out placidly over Sathorn, a commercial district in downtown Bangkok. Now, with its facade stripped back to a concrete frame amid major renovations, the tower affectionately known as the “Robot Building” is barely recognizable, save for its characteristically blocky silhouette.           The building’s owners, the Thai arm of Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB), say the refurbishment will make its headquarters more energy-efficient and employee-friendly. While the company would not share images of the proposed redesign with CNN, conservationists and architects — including the tower’s 84-year-old designer, who says he was shown plans for the new exterior — have expressed dismay at dramatic alterations being made to an icon of Southeast Asian postmodernism.           Completed in 1986, the Robot Building was intended to reflect changes in the banking industry, which at the time was embracing new computer technology. Its designer Sumet Jumsai, who was inspired by one of his son’s toy robots, is considered a major figure in contemporary Thai architecture, and was named a “national artist” by the country’s government.           In an email to CNN, Sumet, who is now retired, decried the “defacement” of his creation. He described renovations as a “devastating statement” demonstrating the “ignorance and arrogance (of) big corporations.”           In March, the architect wrote to UOB Thailand expressing concern over the loss of the tower’s “original iconic features,” including its eyes, and urging it to reconsider plans “before it is too late.” The bank’s response, which was shared with CNN by Sumet, acknowledged that the building was a “significant landmark” — but said the planned refurbishment would bring it “into a new era while paying homage to its heritage.”           The bank added that it will keep a replica of the building’s original form in “a corner of the lobby.”           Originally designed for the Bank of Asia, the tower was acquired by UOB Thailand in 2005. The firm told CNN, via email, that its renovations are focused on “promoting environmental sustainability” and “enhancing employee well-being” for the thousands of workers who will occupy the building upon its reopening in 2025.     Bangkok’s abandoned ‘ghost’ towers still stand 20 years after crash         The organization said its redesign will reduce electricity consumption by at least 15%, with a new glass exterior “minimizing the need for artificial lighting and thus reducing associated… carbon emissions.”           Standing 20 stories high, the Robot Building’s floors get progressively smaller as they rise, giving the structure its distinctive staggered shape. Its iconic lidded “eyes” served as windows for two executive suites on the upper floors, while the building’s toy-like appearance was completed by antennas — used for communications and as lightning rods — and a series of large metallic nuts decorating its sides.           The Robot Building is among a vanishingly small number of landmarks from the era to have survived Bangkok’s breakneck urban development. After recovering from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Thailand’s capital experienced a building boom that transformed areas like Sathorn. Bangkok is now the world’s 14th tallest city, with 112 towers measuring 150 meters (492 feet) or above, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).           The Thai branch of Docomomo International, a non-profit dedicated to preserving modern architecture, said it has identified the relatively diminutive Robot Building in its upcoming list of the country’s 20 “most outstanding” structures.           In an open letter to UOB Thailand, published in April, the conservation group’s president, Pongkwan Lassus, described the Robot Building as an “historical marker” signaling the transition from late modernism to postmodernism — an architectural movement known for decorative facades, ornamentation and a rejection of the mid-century mantra “form follows function.”           Bangkok-based filmmaker Dana Blouin, who is producing an as-yet-unnamed documentary on the Robot Building, said that despite campaigners’ pleas, the tower has now “lost its soul.”     Tokyo’s iconic Nakagin Capsule Tower to be demolished         “We’ve lost something that was probably more important than anyone realized,” he told CNN via video call.           While recognizing the tower may have been viewed as a “novelty,” Blouin said the original design “felt elevated and refined.” He added: “It was still fun, and it was still whimsical. And it was beautiful.”           “When it was built, it was one of the tallest buildings (in Sathorn district),” he said. “Today, the structure is minuscule by comparison — it’s dwarfed by these other glass and steel structures all around it. And that made it all the more special.”           The filmmaker’s affection may not be shared by many in Bangkok. A petition, started in April by campaign groups including Docomomo, had attracted fewer than 1,700 signatures at the time of writing.           Thailand’s conservation efforts and laws, meanwhile, are mostly directed towards the country’s ancient heritage. Campaigners and architects hope that, while it may be too late for the Robot Building, other important examples of contemporary architecture may be spared a similar fate.           “After nearly two decades of effort, we are beginning to see a shift from the government sector,” reads Pongkwan’s letter to UOB Thailand.           For Blouin, a wider cultural shift is needed if other modern Bangkok landmarks are to be preserved. “The embrace of newness… has led to the forgetting of some of these icons,” he said. “And that’s unfortunate.”       CNN’s Kocha Olarn contributed to this story.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,This massive ‘floating’ museum is straight out of science fiction,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/style/chengdu-science-fiction-museum-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,"       The seven-point metallic star floats on the glassy surface of the lake, reminiscent of a far-flung future civilization, or a spaceship touching down on an alien planet. It looks like something straight out of science fiction. Which it is, in a way: it’s the brand new Chengdu Science Fiction Museum in the capital of Sichuan province in Southwest China.           From one side, the dynamic roof mimics the sloping mountains in the distance; from another, the canopy takes on the appearance of a cloud, its cantilever arches suspended above seamless panes of glass.           “From every angle, it will always look different; it will always look unusual or unexpected,” said Paulo Flores, one of the project directors at Zaha Hadid Architects, which designed the museum.           Perhaps more unexpected than the design itself is the time it took to build.           The museum was commissioned in 2022 to host this year’s 81st annual World Science Fiction Convention, nicknamed Worldcon. A building of this size and complexity would typically take four to five years to build, says Flores. But the 59,000 square-meter building — which is three times the size of the Sydney Opera House — went from concept to completion in just 12 months.           But despite the tight turnaround for Flores and his team, it was the dream assignment. “Science fiction has always been a very important source of inspiration for our designs,” said Flores. “Science fiction has always taken that leap forward, looking at what technology is currently and what technology could evolve into.           “We want to be part of that movement of creating what the future looks like — not only visually, but also technologically.”           The London-based architecture firm is no stranger to technology. The firm’s namesake, Zaha Hadid, was a pioneer in digital design, and the tools she used enabled her to create dynamic, futuristic buildings.           “We can only create these types of geometries using polygonal modeling software,” explained Flores, which creates a “three-dimensional simulation of the building.”         With this project, the technology was not only key to creating an ambitious design, but also executing it rapidly. Just two weeks after the firm won the competition, construction on the project began.           Using a variety of design software, including digital modeling analysis, the team was able to accelerate the timeline, and ensure that everyone, from architects to materials manufacturers to construction workers, was on the same page.           Satoshi Ohashi, another one of the project directors, said that construction and design happening in parallel “could not have been done without these new tools.”           Ohashi added that the digital modeling analysis allowed the team to optimize the building’s structure for Chengdu’s climate. By analyzing weather and environmental parameters, the software informed decisions about the size and angle of the roof overhang to protect interiors from direct sunlight.     ‘World’s first off-road solar SUV’ just drove across Morocco powered only by the sun         Green tech is integrated to minimize the building’s operating impact, too, with solar panels embedded into the expansive roof to help power the building, and skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows to reduce the need for artificial light during the day.           The team also had to source materials locally to save time and come up with simple ways of making their concept a reality. For example, they created a modular aluminum panel system that sits “underneath the skin” of the roof canopy, which creates “smooth and seamless” curves while also making it quick to produce in a factory, said Ohashi.           Already home to more than 20 million residents — and growing — Chengdu has rapidly expanded in the last few decades.           Earlier this year, the city topped China’s new first-tier cities list, which ranks metropolises based on factors like resident lifestyle, commercial opportunities, and transport.         The Science Fiction Museum is part of a larger “Future City” development in the Pidu district, outside of the city. Known as Chengdu Future Science and Technology City, the 4.6-square-kilometer (1.8-square-mile) site will house multiple new universities, laboratories and offices.           “Part of that growth is also this attention to the future, science and technology, integrating that into the city, and growing that economy,” Ohashi explained.           The nation’s multi-billion dollar “science fiction industry” includes publishing and film releases, with Chengdu at the center. Chengdu is also the birthplace of Science Fiction World, one of the world’s most-read sci-fi magazines, which was founded in the city in 1979.         The museum opened on schedule to host its inaugural event — the first time Worldcon has been hosted in China, and only the second time in Asia. Dave McCarty, vice-chair of Chengdu Worldcon and an organizer with the event for two decades, described the museum as “the best facility by far that the Worldcon has ever been hosted in,” and said having a purpose-built location made the event feel more special compared to hosting it in “cookie-cutter” convention centers.     ‘Houses That Can Save the World’: These homes offer a blueprint for a greener future         “Having that dedicated space makes a wonderful home for science fiction,” McCarty added.           With its successful bid to host the 81st Worldcon, Ohashi hopes that the new museum and event space can become “an iconic landmark that will represent their science fiction industry” and will nurture the ambitions of the burgeoning “Future City.”           “They can now say that they are China’s science fiction capital,” he said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Skeletons unearthed in ‘incredibly rare’ 5,000-year-old Scottish tomb",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tomb-neolithic-skeletons-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"       The ruins of an “incredibly rare” 5,000-year-old tomb have been uncovered on one of the Scottish Orkney Islands, National Museums Scotland said in a statement on Tuesday.            The excavation at Holm, East Mainland, Orkney, revealed a stone structure accessed through a 7-meter (23-foot) -long passage and traces of a cairn – or pile of stones – that would have covered it, representing the “pinnacle of Neolithic engineering in northern Britain,” the statement said.           Fourteen articulated skeletons of men, women and children, as well as other human remains, were discovered in one of the six smaller side cells that surrounded a large stone chamber.            “In the Neolithic, it would have been an incredibly impressive 15 meter diameter, enormous mound, very substantial stonework, very impressive architecture. Those cells are real feats of engineering,” Hugo Anderson-Whymark, one of the excavation’s co-directors and senior curator of prehistory (Neolithic) at National Museums Scotland, told CNN.     2,300-year-old tomb found in Israel may contain remains of Greek courtesan         Two of the skeletons had been positioned so that they were almost embracing against each other, with two children placed over their heads, Anderson-Whymark said. However, archaeologists have not yet determined the relationships between these individuals.           “The preservation of so many human remains in one part of the monument is amazing, especially since the stone has been mostly robbed for building material,” archaeologist Vicki Cummings, head of the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University, who co-directed the excavation, said in a statement.            “It is incredibly rare to find these tomb deposits, even in well-preserved chambered tombs and these remains will enable new insights into all aspects of these peoples’ lives,” she added.           Only 12 other similar tombs are known to exist in Orkney, referred to as Maes Howe-type passage graves. Most of these remain visible in the landscape – unlike this latest discovery which was buried below ground.           It was largely destroyed in the late 18th or early 19th century to provide stone for building a farmhouse, according to the statement, but later rudimentary excavations in 1896 uncovered eight skeletons and prompted local antiquary James Walls Cursiter to hypothesize that it was a ruined tomb.           Papers held in a private collection of Curister’s notes contained more clues that allowed archaeologists to undertake a geophysical survey in the hope of pinpointing the potential tomb, and provide the basis for the excavation.           “It was quite a surprise to make that discovery,” Anderson-Whymark said. “It’s such a big thing but yet today it’s just a gently rolling field of grass. There’s nothing on the surface to suggest this tomb ever existed there but it would have once been an incredible monument. We’re fortunate they’ve left us just enough of it.”     Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

world,See inside the $50M penthouse that will crown the Waldorf Astoria Miami,https://edition.cnn.com/style/waldorf-astoria-miami-penthouse-apartment/index.html,"       The developers behind Miami’s glittering Waldorf Astoria supertall have unveiled the first look at the 1,049-foot tower’s $50 million penthouse, one of the most expensive units to come to market in the city.           The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom property — which spans some 13,000 square feet — will sit at the top of the nine stacked cubes that make up the vertiginous building, situated on a waterfront stretch in downtown Miami. It’s currently slated to be completed in 2027 by architect Carlos Ott and the firm Sieger Suarez.           Renderings of the penthouse’s interior — designed by the firm BAMO — showcase a modern, airy unit with wraparound windows, enclosed balconies, recessed lighting and luxe marble finishes. Rooms include a private gym, spa, library and theater.           And, when it’s completed, the penthouse will stand out in Miami’s (currently) unobstructed sky. Though a number of skyscrapers are being built or have been proposed in the South Florida metropolis, the Waldorf Astoria Miami hopes to top out first.           “Even with the great skyscrapers of the world — in Dubai, Hong Kong, New York — there’s a lot of towers,” said Ryan Shear, managing partner of the building’s developer, PMG. With the Waldorf Astoria Miami, he continued, “you get to be on top of a world-class city.”     Inside the ‘Bentley’ of luxury residential towers, opening in Miami         With that in mind, the team at BAMO worked with the theme of “transcendence” as they envisioned the building’s interiors, explained principal designer Anne Wilkinson, which include the shared amenities of the building’s 460 residences and 205 hotel rooms and suites.           The Waldorf Astoria brand is known for its mainstays: a grand clock in every location, for example, as well as Peacock Alley, a lounge in the historic New York hotel that has since been replicated in its other properties. In Miami, these spaces are meant to evoke a sense of wonder, with Peacock Alley becoming a “conservatory” in the sky, she said, with sweeping views from three sides on the 19th and 20th floors.           On those floors, the building’s version of a signature clock is a three-story pendulum that Wilkinson says no other Waldorf Astoria location “has ever attempted.” From at the building’s restaurant on the 21st floor, the pendulum swings down to Peacock Alley, nearly sweeping its 19th floor at just 3 feet off the ground.           In the penthouse, Wilkinson said their team took inspiration from the exterior’s geometric architecture in the palette of surfaces and finishings.           “(Carlos Ott) described the skin of the building as this reflective surface… you can imagine every facet of those cubes reflecting a different part of the sky,” she said. “I thought that was such a beautiful notion, so we pulled it into the interior. A lot of our colors are these ethereal grays and blues, and even shifting into nighttime inky colors.”           Though the original Waldorf Astoria on New York’s Fifth Avenue is best-known for its ornamental Art Deco architecture, Wilkinson believes the clean lines of the Miami iteration and its sky-high penthouse fit well within its legacy.           “If you remember back when Waldorf was originally built, Art Deco was quite avant garde,” she said. “And so to me, I think Waldorf is more about being forward-looking. It’s about the design of the moment.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
world,Sydney Opera House at 50: See what Australia’s best-known building could have looked like,https://edition.cnn.com/style/sydney-opera-house-competition-designs/index.html,"       On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II.           Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year.           How different things might have been.           Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties.           A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance, need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations — with organizers setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize.           Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked.           They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers.           “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’ CEO, Gisele Navarro, recalled in a phone interview with CNN.           And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.”           Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges.     Here are seven of the alternative designs that didn’t make the cut:  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
world,Alberto Mier/CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/sport/han-kwang-song-north-korea-spt-intl/index.html,"       After more than three years of going missing from world soccer, North Korean striker Han Kwang Song has reappeared, playing for his country in two recent World Cup qualifiers and scoring in the 6-1 win over Myanmar on Tuesday.     This North Korean player stunned the soccer world – then disappeared         Han first featured for the Chollima against Syria on November 16 – a match played in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah – wearing a white away uniform with the North Korean flag on his chest and the number 10 on his back.           Attempting to qualify for the World Cup for a third time, North Korea lost 1-0. Han then started and scored a powerful header in the 38th minute for the nation in its dominating win against Myanmar in the Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon.           After playing for Qatar club Al-Duhail on August 21, 2020, the young striker – who came to world prominence after playing for a number of Italian soccer teams – had gone missing, nowhere to be seen or heard of.           A CNN investigation found that he had returned to Rome when he was deported from Qatar in early 2021 and had stayed at an unspecified North Korean embassy until flights back to Pyongyang resumed just this August. It is unclear when and how he returned home.           The North Korea football federation, the Asian Football Confederation and world soccer governing body FIFA didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on Han’s return to international football.           The return of the North Korean wunderkind has surprised soccer pundits and fans, who worried about his safety and promising career being cut short.           Max Canzi, who coached Han at Serie A club Cagliari’s Under-19 team, said he is “very happy” for the striker to return.           “Very curious about the level of his performance after being out for so much time,” Canzi told CNN Sport, after learning that Han had reappeared in the loss against Syria.           Han’s former teammate Nicholas Pennington at Cagliari told CNN Sport: “Hopefully, Han stays in the spotlight and the fact that there is concern helps him get back to where he should be.”           Listed in the roster for North Korea’s World Cup qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar were not just Han, but also Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok – who played for Austria’s SKN St. Pölten and Italy’s SS Arezzo, respectively, until they were forced to stop due to the UN sanctions that ordered the repatriation of all overseas North Korean workers by the end of 2019.           In 2017, Han became the first North Korean to score a goal in one of Europe’s five major soccer leagues and even made a shock transfer to Italian giant Juventus in 2019, then later to Qatar’s Al-Duhail.           The young striker from Pyongyang quickly drew attention from soccer pundits and fans – not just for his unique background, but for his technical prowess as well.           But his promising career was cut short when he disappeared from the world soccer stage in 2020, leaving fans with a question: “Where in the world was Han?”           Han’s career was affected by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) imposing sanctions against North Korea for conducting its sixth nuclear test in 2017.           The sanctions ordered member states to repatriate all North Korean nationals working in their respective jurisdictions amid concerns that foreign money was being transferred to support Kim Jong Un’s nuclear and weapons programs. The UNSC resolution set the end of 2019 as the deadline for repatriation.           The Covid-19 pandemic led to North Korea fully sealing its borders, making it impossible for Han and fellow repatriated North Korean nationals to return home.           He had been due to fly out of Qatar in 2021 in accordance with the UN sanctions – but then vanished. A CNN investigation into his story shed new light on his disappearance.           After joining Al-Duhail in January 2020, in the middle of the Qatar Stars League 2019/20 season, Han went on to play in 10 league games, scoring three goals and playing a significant role in the club’s league title win.           Qatar had signed the North Korean on a five-year, $4.6 million (€4,310,000) contract until the 2023/24 season; as such, Han was remunerated around $296,200 (€270,000) between February and April 2020, according to the UNSC report of the Panel of Experts from mid-2020.           Though Han was performing admirably on the pitch, questions remained over whether he was sending money back to his homeland, as the UNSC said of other North Koreans working abroad.           The UN document shows Han had signed a pledge to a Qatari bank to not transfer “any money cost or amount to North Korea in any cases.”           Although it is unclear in Han’s case whether he had been sending money back to the Kim regime, it is widely reported that North Korea often forces its workers abroad to send money to the government back home.           The UNSC Panel of Experts in another report released in March 2020 said it was investigating North Korean nationals suspected of earning income overseas, which also include “specialists, such as sports players.”           Han’s last game for Al-Duhail was on August 21, 2020, when he came off the bench against Al-Ahli in the season finale.           It would be the last time soccer fans would see Han play on the professional level until now. By the time the new season kicked off the following month, Han was gone – no longer in the starting line-up nor on the bench, with no news emerging of any transfer.           Months passed without any update regarding Han’s whereabouts until a UNSC final report of the Panel of Experts released in March 2021 confirmed that the player’s contract had been terminated with Al-Duhail earlier that year and he was deported from Qatar.           Han boarded a Qatar Airways flight from Doha on January 26, 2021, when he was deported, according to a letter attached in the UNSC’s final report of the Panel of Experts.           However, as Han could not return home due to North Korea closing its borders because of the pandemic, the flight took him back to Rome.           Before playing for North Korea against Syria in last week’s World Cup qualifier, Han was last reported to be living in an unspecified North Korean embassy in 2021, awaiting the resumption of flights back to Pyongyang, according to another official close to the issue.           In May 2021, North Korea pulled out of qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and didn’t take part in the Tokyo Summer Olympics or the Beijing Winter Games, officially citing the coronavirus pandemic.           “North Korea has been barred from competing at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as part of its punishment for its ‘unilateral decision’ to drop out of the Tokyo Games this summer,” the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in 2021.   HT | 🇲🇲 Myanmar 0️⃣-3️⃣ DPR Korea 🇰🇵The visitors hold a commanding lead at the break 💪Can the home side get back in the game ❓#AsianQualifiers pic.twitter.com/jmSyLDwM0X        The already-isolated country had fully shut its borders when the pandemic began in 2020 and has only recently lifted the restrictions to bring back its nationals living abroad like Han, who was stranded with no way to return home all this time.           Then this past September, Pyongyang sent a large number of athletes to Hangzhou, China, for the 2022 Asian Games, which was postponed a year due to the pandemic.           Unlike the women’s team, which reached the soccer final of the Asian Games before losing to Japan, North Korea’s men’s national team has had relatively poor results in international competitions.           While the women’s team will be remembered for its impressive campaign – notably beating South Korea 4-1 – the men’s team made an embarrassing exit after receiving six yellow cards and fiercely confronting the referees after falling to Japan 2-1 in quarterfinal.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,US men’s soccer team shocked by Trinidad and Tobago but still makes Nations League semifinals,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/sport/usa-defeat-trinidad-and-tobago-concacaf-nations-league-spt-intl/index.html,"       The US Men’s National Team suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago in the second leg of its CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal, but survived the upset to reach the semifinals 4-2 on aggregate.           Fulham defender Antonee Robinson got the US men off to a flying start with a goal after 25 minutes, but the match was turned on its head when a moment of madness from Sergiño Dest resulted in the 23-year-old picking up two yellow cards in the space of 30 seconds.           Dest, who assisted Robinson’s opening goal, picked up his first booking for deliberately kicking the ball into the stands in frustration at a refereeing decision. After being shown a yellow card, Dest continued to berate the referee and then blew kisses at him, resulting in an almost immediate second booking and a red card.           After the match, Dest issued an apology on social media and called his actions “immature.”           “I want to apologize to my teammates, staff, fans and whole nation for my behaviour,” he wrote on Instagram. “It was unacceptable, selfish and immature - I let my team down! It’s something I have to learn from and it won’t happen again.”           US captain Tim Ream said he had “no explanation” for Dest’s reaction.           “There’s not too many things that I can say here, publicly, that we said privately,” Ream told reporters after the game. “Overall, it’s a complete lack of respect for the guys that are playing, for the guys that are on the bench, a feeling of a lack of respect for the game itself and for the referees.           “For me, it’s just a feeling of disrespect, to be completely honest with you, and that’s something he needs to understand because it completely changes the game, but then it completely changes any type of potential plan.”           Head coach Gregg Berhalter also did not hold back in his assessment of Dest’s attitude on the pitch.           “It is concerning because that’s not what we want to represent,” Berhalter told reporters, per Reuters. “As a team, players, the staff, we need to hold him accountable because it’s inexcusable.           “It really is and we were very firm with our words after the game. He put a number of guys in jeopardy and made a number of guys do a lot of extra work in this weather and it’s inexcusable.           “He’s a young player, he’s a fantastic part of this team. He’s going to learn, he’s going to grow. He made a dumb mistake and he knows that,” Berhalter added.           With a numerical advantage, Trinidad and Tobago came from behind to win the match 2-1 thanks to goals from Reon Moore and Alvin Jones, but it wasn’t enough to reach the semifinals as the US had won the first leg in Texas, 3-0.           This year’s CONCACAF Nations League also acts as the qualifiers for the expanded 2024 Copa América, which will take place in the United States. By reaching the last four, the US has secured its place in the competition, but Trinidad and Tobago will now play a single-elimination match to decide whether it will be one of the six CONCACAF teams participating.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,‘Why did the VAR keep silent?’ Ukrainian media slams ‘scandalous’ decision in Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/sport/ukraine-italy-euro-2024-var-penalty-spt-intl/index.html,"       There have been a plethora of questionable calls made this season with the help of soccer’s Video Assistant Referee (VAR), but the decision not to award a penalty to Ukraine in the dying seconds of its crucial Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy on Tuesday is arguably one of the most controversial.           With the score still 0-0 in the third minute of additional time, Italy midfielder Bryan Cristante seemingly tripped Mykhailo Mudryk inside the penalty area, but referee Jesús Gil Manzano, who had a clear view from just 10 yards away, didn’t give the foul.           Stranger still, it appears as though VAR didn’t even review the challenge.           CNN has reached out to European football’s governing body UEFA and the Ukraine football federation for comment.           Ukraine needed to win to finish second in the group and qualify automatically for Euro 2024, but a draw was enough for Italy to go through as runners-up to England. The match finished 0-0, meaning Ukraine will now take part in the Euro playoffs in March next year.           The mood in the Ukrainian media after the match was understandably one of frustration.           Outlet UkrFootball called the decision a “scandalous situation.”     Speaking to UkrFootball, Ukrainian former FIFA referee Miroslav Stupar said: “It seems that there was no VAR in this game.           “I have one question: why did the VAR referee keep silent at the moment with Mudryk?” Stupar added. “The head referee saw this episode clearly, but was afraid to take responsibility and give a penalty. Even VAR did not go to watch [the foul].           “If he had watched it, he would definitely have given a penalty because there was contact. The referee didn’t want to expose himself.           “If he had gone to watch VAR, it would have been a self-inflicted wound for him. But if he didn’t give a penalty, then he should have given Mudryk a yellow card for simulation.”           Outlet TSN called it an “an erroneous decision.”           “Not only the fans agreed that Ukraine had been ‘robbed’ but also the global media, which actively responded to the high-profile episode on social media.”           Football24, another Ukrainian outlet wrote: “For some reason, the referee did not award a penalty, and VAR decided not to correct the referee’s mistake.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Philadelphia Eagles win Super Bowl rematch, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-17",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/sport/philadelphia-eagles-kansas-city-chiefs-nfl-mnf-spt-intl/index.html,"       The Philadelphia Eagles avenged their Super Bowl LVII defeat on Monday night as they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-17, on the road at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri.           While February’s championship game was a free-scoring offensive masterclass from both sides, Monday’s matchup was not the prettiest. The two teams combined for 13 punts while each squad’s quarterback threw an interception apiece.           The Eagles were limited to 78 total net yards of offense in the first half, per the NFL, and 70 of those came on one touchdown drive. Star QB Jalen Hurts ended the game with only 150 yards, an interception and no passing touchdowns, but the Eagles still managed to escape with the ugly victory.           “Whoever was going to win that game was going to do it gritty, grimy, nasty, all those adjectives,” Philadelphia head coach Nick Sirianni said after the game. “It was going to be that way, and the guys just stayed together and kept fighting, and kept grinding it out, and we were able to come out on top.”           The Chiefs will come away from Monday’s game feeling incredibly frustrated, as the stat sheet suggested that they did enough to come away with the win. They outgained the Eagles by 98 yards, converted on 47% of their 3rd downs to Philly’s 27% and the offensive line allowed only one quarterback sack (on the first play of the game). Hurts, conversely, was brought down on five occasions.           The Chiefs opened up the scoring towards the end of the first quarter. Reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes found Justin Watson in the end zone before Eagles running back D’Andre Swift leveled things up on the next drive.           The Super Bowl champions restored their advantage in the second through Travis Kelce, who caught his 74th career touchdown pass to move into joint-fifth place for most receiving TDs by a tight end.           A Harrison Butker field goal to cap off the quarter meant that Kansas City entered halftime with a 10-point lead and appeared on course for another victory over Philadelphia.           However, the tables turned after the break as the Eagles’ defense stepped up and shut out the Chiefs for the entirety of the second half.           Hurts may not have had the most productive day through the air, but he was able to contribute on scoring plays on the ground. A rushing TD up the middle in the third quarter got the Eagles back into the game, and he was shoved across the goal line in the fourth as the Philadelphia executed its trademark ‘tush push.’           Hurts’ second rushing touchdown put the Eagles up four with just over six minutes to go and the Chiefs were still very much in the game, but were left to rue their mistakes as time expired.           The Chiefs had already turned over the ball on their first fourth quarter drive via a Kelce fumble in the red zone, before the game literally slipped through their fingers on their final possession.           Mahomes could only watch in despair as his perfect 50+ yard pass was dropped by wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling as he was across the goal line with under two minutes left in the game.           The Eagles were able to get the defensive stop on fourth down to wrap up the win, meaning that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid tasted defeat against his former side for the first time.           Philly is now a league-best 9-1 while Kansas City is 7-3 and has already lost as many games in Week 11 as it did in the entirety of the last regular season.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/01/world/cnn-heroes-top-10-2023/index.html,"       The ideas can be simple: converting a vehicle into a wash station for homeless veterans. Providing books for kids while they wait at the barbershop. Turning a passion for diving into a movement to save coral reefs.           These are just some of the incredible efforts performed by the people who have been selected as this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Each will receive a $10,000 prize.           Their journey began with nominations sent in by CNN’s audience and now you can vote to help decide who will be named the 2023 CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.           All of the honorees will receive a grant along with organizational and capacity-building support from The Elevate Prize Foundation. They will also participate in the foundation’s annual Make Good Famous Summit in Miami.           ﻿CNN has teamed up with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s honorees and learn more about their stories. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ nonprofit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.           The CNN Hero of the Year will be revealed live during “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” hosted by Anderson Cooper on Sunday, December 10, starting at 8 p.m. ET.           Read more about each of this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes, below:           Growing up, Yasmine Arrington knew firsthand the challenges that came with having an incarcerated parent.           “My father has been in and out of jail and prison my entire life,” she said. “I began to do research, and I learned that there’s so many other people that are kind of my age experiencing what I’m experiencing.”           When she was 16, she created the nonprofit ScholarCHIPS – with CHIPS as an acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents – to help young people like herself with scholarships, mentoring and a network of support.           The organization has since awarded more than $450,000 in scholarships and other aid and supported more than 80 scholars working toward their college degrees. New scholars join the program each year.           In many regions of Ghana, it can take hours to get to the nearest hospital. As a result, many people lose their lives to treatable illnesses. Osei Boateng experienced this personally when he lost his grandmother and aunt.           Feeling an urgent call to help, Boateng decided he would make it his life’s mission to bring health care to remote communities in Ghana.           “These people don’t have the luxury of time,” Boateng said.           Boateng started his nonprofit, OKB Hope Foundation, and in 2021, he converted a van into a mobile doctor’s office and started bringing health care directly to those in need.           A few times a week, the mobile clinic and medical team travel long distances to remote communities in Ghana and provide free routine medical care.           In 2008, a stroke and subsequent traumatic brain injury (TBI) nearly killed Stacey Buckner. Today, she says her miraculous road to recovery led her to the outreach work that has become her life’s mission.           Through her program, Off-Road Outreach, Buckner has helped more than 1,000 veterans in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Using her own off-road vehicle – a Jeep that has accommodations for water, heating, and cooking – Buckner provides mobile showers, laundry services, and meals to homeless veterans.           Since 2015, Buckner travels to hard-to-reach places each week to find and serve veterans in need. Without judgment, Buckner asks what she can do to help them.           “There should be no homeless vets, period,” Buckner said. “I am to a lot of them their only family.”           In 1996, Mike Goldberg left his job in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving. Goldberg and his family later settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.           As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE.           Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving.           “There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said.           When Tescha Hawley received her breast cancer diagnosis at age 46, the lifesaving treatment she needed several times a month was at a hospital a three-hour drive away.           Hawley, a member of the Gros Ventre tribe, has two master’s degrees, yet the challenges she had to navigate to receive the care she needed were daunting. As a single mother, Hawley ultimately took leave without pay to complete her treatment.           “As American Indian people, we represent the highest (rates) of everything – diabetes, heart disease, cancer – and we receive the poorest health care,” Hawley said.           After her experience, Hawley founded the Day Eagle Hope Project in 2017, and her nonprofit has since expanded to address many other needs of Native Americans in her community.           In 2008, first grade teacher Alvin Irby stopped by a Bronx barbershop after school for a haircut. Before long, one of his students came in.           “He’s kind of looking bored,” Irby recalled. “I’m looking at this student (thinking), ‘He should be practicing his reading.’ But I didn’t have a book.”           That moment stayed with Irby, and five years later he started Barbershop Books. Since 2013, the nonprofit has brought more than 50,000 free children’s books to more than 200 barbershops in predominantly Black neighborhoods across the country.           Irby is working to change lower literacy rates by encouraging boys to read for fun, on their own.           “Our program is about getting kids to say three words: ‘I’m a reader,’” he said.           Kevin Pearce was at the height of his professional snowboarding career and bound for the Winter Olympics. During training, he struck his head on the edge of a halfpipe, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.           He had to relearn how to walk and talk. He eventually started yoga, and his family saw how it transformed him and gave him a sense of hope.           “I remember … coming out of a class with him and just seeing in his face this new expression, this new person,” his brother Adam Pearce said.           Wanting to bring hope and healing to others through yoga and meditation, Adam and Kevin co-founded the LoveYourBrain Foundation. The organization aims to create a safe space and supportive community where people with a TBI can heal together.           Estefanía Rebellón understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too.           In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana, Mexico, that she put her acting career on hold.           “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said.           Rebellón and her partner used their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the US-Mexico border. Then they transformed buses into mobile classrooms to reach more families.           Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the border. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children.           Every parent’s worst nightmare is losing their child. Shamayim Harris has lived through that nightmare – twice.           Her 2-year-old son was struck and killed in a hit-and-run in 2007 in Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Years later, her 23-year-old son was shot and killed while on a neighborhood watch.           “I needed to … change grief into glory, pain into power,” said Harris, who is known as Mama Shu.           In 2016, she created the Avalon Village, a nonprofit with the mission of creating a safe and nurturing space for the entire Highland Park community. Today, she and her organization own 45 lots of land across three blocks. The biggest project has been fully refurbishing an abandoned house into an after-school hub for children.           Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.           Stewart treated the dog’s skin condition and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was a wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.           Stewart’s nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness.           “It doesn’t matter what your situation is … I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help,” Stewart said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"For hundreds of migrant children living in shelters at the border, this CNN Hero’s mobile classrooms offer education and stability",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/06/americas/california-mexico-border-school-migrants-cnnheroes/index.html,"       Estefanía Rebellón knows the trauma that stems from being forced to flee your home for safety. She understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world.           She was a migrant child, too.           “My family’s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border. It was never a choice for our family to leave our home. We were forced out of it,” Rebellón, 32, said.            She was 10 when her family fled Cali, Colombia, because of death threats to her father, who had been forced into hiding. They settled in Miami, and with the support of teachers at school, Rebellón thrived. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the US-Mexico border.           Rebellón moved from Miami to Los Angeles when she was 21 to pursue an acting career. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana that she put her career on hold.            “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. “I couldn’t forget about what I had just seen. And I was like, ‘I literally have to go back.’”           Rebellón and her partner, Kyle Schmidt, used about $1,000 of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border. They enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps.           “We set up a school overnight and … told just a couple of kids,” Rebellón said. “It spread throughout the camp, and we had like over 50 kids surrounding us.”           In the months that followed, when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters, Rebellón and Schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services.           “I thought, “Why don’t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom, and we could take it to all the different shelters?” Rebellón said. “We literally just Googled and YouTubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom.”           Over the next year, Rebellón and Schmidt bought and gutted a bus, partnered with shelters, and drove the transformed bus over the border. Their goal: to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school.           “All the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum,” Rebellón said. “They’re going through all the processes that are being required of them.”           Rebellón’s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student. The program has been accredited by the education secretary in Mexico and serves children ages 3 to 15 – a crucial period for education, Rebellón says.            Despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child, she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way.            Many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time. Many have been on the road for months, if not years, and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit, without a permanent home. Safety, economic instability, poverty, lack of transportation, and perceived legal status are also factors.           “People don’t realize that this is such a long process for families,” Rebellón said. “It’s not just like you arrive at the border, you seek asylum, and your life is all rainbows. It takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain.”           Rebellón’s family navigated a decades-long legal process to obtain political asylum and later US citizenship. Her parents, both lawyers by trade, were forced to abandon their careers in Colombia and take on new jobs in the US to support their family of five. Her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at Walmart. He has worked there full time for nearly 20 years.              “Any time I get a chance, I share my immigration story with (the kids),” Rebellón said. “I always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of.”           Today, Yes We Can Foundation educates 250-300 kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children from 10 countries.           Their program runs Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. School runs for the entire year, with no summer breaks. They also provide free uniforms, backpacks, and school supplies. Lessons focus on common core instruction in the subjects of language arts, math, and science as well as addressing practical and immediate needs like how to translate basic information including phone numbers and addresses.           “I want our efforts to be something permanent,” Rebellón said. “And that when it’s all said and done, we will be proud to look back and say that we were there when people needed us the most.”     Want to get involved?

politics,Rick Bowmer/AP/FILE,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/celeste-maloy-utah-special-election-house/index.html,"       Republican Celeste Maloy will win the special election Tuesday for Utah’s 2nd Congressional District, CNN projects, filling the only remaining vacancy in the US House of Representatives.           With Maloy’s victory, House Republicans will return to a 222-213 majority, giving Speaker Mike Johnson some breathing room as he faces a looming government spending fight, though he still controls only a very narrow majority. But that may be temporary, with members weighing a possible expulsion of Republican Rep. George Santos.           Maloy will defeat Democratic state Sen. Kathleen Riebe in the reliably red district that covers the western portion of the state, stretching from the Salt Lake City area to St. George. She will succeed her onetime boss, former GOP Rep. Chris Stewart, and will be the first woman in Utah’s congressional delegation since Republican Mia Love left office in 2019.           Stewart left office in September over his wife’s health concerns. Maloy, who worked as a counsel in Stewart’s Washington office, had his endorsement on her way to securing the GOP nod. She advanced to the September primary by winning a nominating convention in June. She then won a three-way primary contest, besting former state Rep. Becky Edwards and former Utah GOP Chairman Bruce Hough.           Maloy faced questions over her eligibility for the special election primary ballot related to voter registration issues. She was marked inactive in the state’s voter database because she did not cast a ballot in 2020 and 2022, according to The Salt Lake Tribune, after she relocated to Virginia to work for Stewart. But the state GOP submitted her name for the ballot, noting that no objections to her candidacy were filed before the convention.           On the campaign trail, Maloy often touted her experience as a congressional aide to make the case that she has already been serving the district.           “Congress is struggling right now. Things aren’t going smoothly,” Maloy said at a debate last month. “We really need somebody to get into this seat who knows how Congress works, who knows how to work with people and who already knows this district.”           Maloy, who also made government spending a focus of her campaign, will join a Congress staring down two deadlines in January and February to keep the government funded.           “I’m willing to vote for a spending bill that reduces spending,” Maloy said at the debate when asked whether she would support bipartisan government funding legislation. “As long as we’re cutting spending and moving in the right direction, there’s no need to shut down the government.”           A sizable minority of House Republicans did not back the stopgap measure enacted last week to keep the government open because it did not include the deep spending cuts that conservatives had demanded and instead extended funding at current levels.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Former Trump Org. controller breaks down in tears on witness stand in fraud trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/mcconney-trump-org-testimony-fraud-trial/index.html,"       After four days of testimony and two trips to the witness stand, former Trump Organization controller Jeff McConney broke down in tears on Tuesday, telling the court the toll of the numerous investigations and accusations of misconduct drove him to leave the company he loved working for after 35 years.           “I just couldn’t do it anymore,” McConney said. “I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for.”           The emotional outcry came when Jesus Suarez, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, asked McConney before the lunch break why he left the Trump Org.     Takeaways from the first week of Trump’s defense in the $250 million civil fraud trial         Before answering the question McConney took a long pause, removed his glasses, and threw his arms in the air. Trump attorney Alina Habba motioned to a court officer to bring him a box of tissues. Judge Arthur Engoron gave her a thumbs up.           He apologized for his emotional reaction, “Sorry.”           The former long-time Trump Org. controller, who is a co-defendant in the civil fraud trial, said being subjected to several subpoenas and testifying in connection to multiple government cases accusing him of wrongdoing had taken a toll on him.           Pausing at times to wipe his eyes, McConney gave a lengthy answer describing his love for working for the company and ​said he​ remains proud of his 35-year career.           “I feel proud of what I did. I think everything was justified. Numbers don’t represent fully what these assets are worth,” McConney said. “I got to do a lot of things normally an accountant wouldn’t be able to do. I’m very proud of the work I did for 35 years.”           But after several years of investigations accusing him of inflating asset valuations on Trump’s financial statements, he grew frustrated and said, “I gave up.”           McConney acknowledged on cross examination that he’s received all but $125,000 of a $500,000 severance package from Trump Org.           Assistant New York Attorney General Andrew Amer pushed back on McConney’s testimony that it was the outside accounting firm Mazars that wrote most of the notes and disclaimers on Trump’s personal financial statements.           McConney, under questioning from a Trump attorney on Monday, shifted the blame to Mazars and Donald Bender, ​who he says reviewed and could have advised them about any inflated asset values on Trump’s personal financial statements that are at the heart of the civil fraud trial.           Amer showed McConney a collection of his own handwritten edits on the statement drafts that he had attributed to Mazars in earlier testimony.           At one point while reviewing his own handwritten notes, McConney acknowledged his memory was “incorrect” about a specific disclosure on Trump’s statement. Seeing the handwritten edits also published in the final statement version, he acknowledged he must have primarily written the disclosure about asset valuations that deviated from generally accepted accounting principles.           Amer also suggested McConney was involved in the financial statements as recently as 2021 although he testified earlier at trial that he passed off the duty to another accounting executive Patrick Birney around 2016.           Amer showed the court handwritten notations from McConney on 2021 financial statement drafts.     Judge temporarily lifts gag order in Trump’s civil fraud trial         Among the 2021 notes, the former controller wrote that Eric Trump needed to review the footnotes for the section on club facilities. On another page McConney wrote that Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr, both defendants in the case, should review the statements.           McConney eventually said, “I had a little bit of input.”           McConney said he did the best he could to make the notes on his spreadsheets accurate “to let the reader of the spreadsheet know where the numbers were coming from.”           The trial will resume Monday after the Thanksgiving break with Trump Hotels CFO Mark Hawthorn expected to testify.           Deutsche Bank lenders who worked with Trump Org. on several loans at issue in this case are expected to testify under subpoena next Tuesday.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

politics,"Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/negotiations-israel-hamas-hostages/index.html," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu grabbed Brett McGurk’s arm as he walked out of a tense meeting of the Israeli Cabinet over securing the release of hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza.     “We need this deal,” Netanyahu told the White House Middle East coordinator a week ago in Tel Aviv, according to sources familiar with the exchange.         Earlier that day, Netanyahu and President Joe Biden had agreed over the phone that they were ready to accept the broad contours of a deal for Hamas to release 50 women and children who were being held hostage.         A major breakthrough had come two days earlier on November 12. Hamas – after refusing for days – had relented in offering identifying information about several dozen hostages, such as their age, gender and nationalities. The information confirmed that numerous children and toddlers had been taken captive on October 7.           Even though Israel and the US believed there were more than 50 women and children hostages, both sides agreed that they needed to move ahead with securing the release of those 50 – and hope that the deal might incentivize Hamas to release more after the initial group.           But hours after McGurk’s meeting with Netanyahu, everything went dark.           The Qataris – who had been playing the main mediating role – couldn’t get a hold of Hamas. When the group finally resurfaced, Hamas threatened to derail the talks: It demanded that the Israel Defense Forces, which had gone in to raid Al-Shifa hospital, leave the hospital grounds. IDF declined but indicated that it would keep the hospital running.           Once the talks resumed, Biden – who was in San Francisco having just finished a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping – placed one more call to the emir of Qatar. His message: Time was up. The emir gave Biden his assurances that he would do everything possible to close the deal.           The next day, McGurk met in person with the emir in Doha to examine the text of the final deal that by this point was around half a dozen pages long. It laid out how women and children would leave in the first phase, as well as incentives for Hamas to release more hostages beyond that. CIA Director Bill Burns was dialed in to the meeting by phone.           Israel’s war cabinet approved the deal after making minor changes on Sunday, and the text of the agreement was passed on to Hamas for the last time by the emir of Qatar.           The emir made clear: This is the final offer.           On Tuesday morning, Hamas responded to their Qatari interlocutors: They approved the deal.           While efforts to negotiate a deal began in the immediate days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the groundwork for the deal started coming together weeks later, after the Biden administration had confidence that communication with Hamas via the Qataris was effective. Officials would later describe this as their “pilot” negotiation.           On October 23, the White House had successfully secured the release of two American citizens from Gaza – Natalie and Judith Raanan. As the mother and daughter made their way across Gaza, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer and McGurk were huddled in Sullivan’s office, tracking the Raanans’ movements in real time. Sources described their multi-hour journey as “excruciating.”           When the women arrived at the border, Charge d’Affaires Stephanie Hallett was waiting for them. At this point, Biden placed a call to Natalie Raanan’s father to share the joyful news, and later in the day, he would speak with both women.           That day would serve as proof to Biden’s top national security officials that the White House had successfully established a means of communicating and negotiating with Hamas via Qatar. And it triggered what would ultimately become the weeks-long effort to secure the release of a larger group of hostages.           After the Israelis delegated the director of Mossad to negotiate on the hostages, back in the US, Burns, too, became intimately involved.           In Doha, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani engaged directly with senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, a person familiar with the discussions said.           In multiple phone calls in October, Biden impressed upon Netanyahu that there was a path for a large group of hostages to be released. On October 24, Hamas appeared to agree to the parameters of a deal to release women and children hostages. American and Israeli officials furiously deliberated whether Israel should delay its ground invasion.           Ultimately, Israel wasn’t convinced. At this point, they still had no proof of life of any of the hostages that Hamas claimed to have, and they also didn’t buy Hamas’ claim that they couldn’t determine the identities of the hostages until there was a pause in fighting.           Israel began its ground invasion on October 27.           In the weeks that followed, the US, Israel and Qatar went back and forth with Hamas, negotiating with the group about every detail of a possible deal: the timeframe, number of hostages, safe passage corridors and surveillance.           Blinken returned to Israel in early November to press the Israeli government to accept “humanitarian pauses,” something that the US argued would advance progress on the hostages. Although there was an agreement in principle after Blinken met with Netanyahu and the war cabinet, the Israeli prime minister publicly rejected the idea just hours after that meeting. It took days of pressure from the US for the Israeli government to institute and acknowledge “tactical pauses.”           The talks at times seemed to move painfully slow, as each step of the communication moved from Doha, Qatar, or Cairo to Hamas in Gaza, then back again, before being relayed to Israel and the US.           “Every step of this is like pulling teeth,” one official said at the time.         Behind the scenes, the hostages were the key issue that prevented Israel from initially agreeing to a humanitarian pause, because the Israeli government did not want to signal any kind of relief in exchange for hostages, a senior State Department official said.           Numerous different permutations of a deal were discussed.           Israeli and US officials initially insisted that all women and children come out in the first part of the release. Hamas would only guarantee 50 and refused to produce identifying information about the hostages. By the time that Burns met in Doha with the emir of Qatar and David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, the fact that there was no identifying information about the hostages was a major sticking point.           On November 12, Biden informed the emir of Qatar that the negotiation could not move forward without this information in what a senior administration official described as a “very important and very intense call.” Shortly after, Hamas finally relented, seemingly guaranteeing that any final deal would entail the release of 50 women and children hostages.           While the deal reached this week only returns 50 women and children, US officials projected confidence Tuesday that the agreement will ultimately pave the way for additional hostage releases.           There are 10 Americans who remain unaccounted for, including two women and a 3-year-old girl. Pressed by CNN on the remaining Americans, a senior administration official said the White House remains “determined to get everybody home,” and suggested that the deal is structured to “very much (incentivize) the release of everybody.”           An agreement to release hostages from Hamas would “unlock the potential for delivery of more humanitarian assistance” into Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday.           After their safe passage, the released hostages will be given medical attention in Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, suggesting that some could have longer-term medical needs following six weeks in “abhorrent conditions.” Then there will be efforts to repatriate citizens to their home countries and connect them with their families.           For any American citizens released, Kirby said, after medical care is prioritized, the US State Department will provide consular assistance.           It could be 24 to 48 hours before the Biden administration has confirmation as to whether the two American women and orphaned American 3-year-old were among those released, one US official said.

politics,Georgia judge declines to send Trump co-defendant in election fraud case to jail over social media posts,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/harrison-floyd-georgia-election-bond-hearing/index.html,"       The judge overseeing the Fulton County election racketeering case declined Tuesday to send one of Donald Trump’s co-defendants to jail over recent social media posts and other comments he made targeting witnesses.           Judge Scott McAfee said that while the defendant, Harrison Floyd, made “technical violations” of his bond agreement, “not every violation compels revocation.”           The judge, however, modified Floyd’s bond agreement, adding a restriction on his social media activity. Floyd is prohibited from making any social media post “of any kind on any platform, whether public or private, concerning any codefendant or witness in this case or concerning any person specifically named in the indictment,” according to the modified bond agreement.           Fulton County prosecutors had asked McAfee to revoke Floyd’s bond, arguing that he’s violated the terms of the agreement meant to keep him out of jail because of his alleged “effort to intimidate codefendants and witnesses.”           Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis personally argued the case Tuesday, the first time she has appeared in court for a pre-trial hearing in the sprawling election subversion racketeering case.           “What we are really here to decide today is does this order mean something or not. He does not get an ‘oh, I’m sorry,’ after I’ve already intimidated the witnesses in this case,” Willis said. “It is too late.”     Trump’s gag order appeal previews America’s grave election year stress test         Had McAfee granted prosecutors’ requests, Floyd would have been the first defendant to be jailed for their actions related to the case – a move that would have sent a strong message to the other defendants that prosecutors are closely watching their public maneuverings as the criminal case unfolds.           “He was given an opportunity to cooperate with the rules of this case and what he really did was spit on the court and refuse to oblige by three of the seven conditions of this bond order,” Willis said.           Floyd, who has pleaded not guilty to three state felonies, has before been behind bars after being indicted earlier this year. The only defendant to have spent time in jail in connection with the case, Floyd was incarcerated at the Fulton County Jail for one week in August before reaching a bond deal with prosecutors.           The felonies Floyd faces in the case are largely tied to his role in an intimidation campaign targeting two Atlanta election workers in late 2020. Trump and his allies falsely accused the workers of massive voter fraud.           The leader of Black Voices for Trump, Floyd was separately charged in May with simple assault of a federal officer who was delivering a subpoena to him to testify before a grand jury in Washington, DC. He has not entered a plea in that case.           Floyd’s attorneys on Monday pushed back hard against prosecutors’ bid to jail him, telling McAfee that they were doing so out of retaliation after he rejected a plea deal offer. They also draw comparisons to Trump’s public comments about the case, suggesting that prosecutors’ decision to not go after Trump was evidence of a double standard.           “A review of President Trump’s social media posts make the State’s decision to go after Harrison Floyd hard to justify,” Floyd’s attorneys wrote, citing several posts from Trump about Sidney Powell, an attorney who recently pleaded guilty in the case, as well as Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff and current co-defendant.           “None of these posts amount to a threat or intimidation,” Floyd’s attorney Chris Kachouroff said of his client’s posts on Tuesday, noting that none of the witnesses presented in court contacted authorities about the case.           “We need to give Floyd the benefit of the doubt,” Kachouroff later added. “Did he walk up close to the line? Yes.”     Georgia judge issues order to prevent future leaks of sensitive evidence in Trump election racketeering case         In their request last week, Fulton County prosecutors highlighted Floyd’s recent social media posts about Georgia election officials who are likely to be called as witnesses in the case, as well as his recent comments on a conservative podcast about Jenna Ellis, who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate.           “The Defendant’s actions demonstrate that he poses a significant threat of intimidating witnesses and otherwise obstructing the administration of justice in the future, making him ineligible for bond,” they wrote in the court filing.           In one recent post, Floyd questioned why his team was accused of leaking videos of conversations between another defendant and prosecutors, invoking Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, who is a witness in the case.           “Why would my team leak Jenna Ellis & proffer videos when there is better stuff? For instance, Ruby Freeman’s job was the reconciliation of ballots,” he wrote. “She wasn’t even supposed to be on a scanner !!!!!!”           Michael Hill, an assistant chief investigator in Fulton County testified about Floyd’s recent social media posts on X about the case, with the witnesses reading aloud each post, at times taking care to translate internet-speak to adhere to courtroom decorum.           “The content is as follows: ‘Black American Dems want the ‘Black Trump Guy’ to tell on the ‘RACIST WHITE REPUBLICANS’ but only if it’s President Trump? Lol, look, the truth is that @GASecofState and @GabrielSterling are the pieces of’ – and it’s a …” Hill read, before Willis interjected.           “Emoji – can you just spell that word as opposed to putting profanity in the record,” she said.           “Yes, ma’am. It’s an emoji of poop or fecal matter emoji,” Hill said. “’They are the pieces of – that emoji – you should be mad at.’”           Later during the hearing, Willis called Gabriel Sterling, an election official in the state who testified that while it’s common for people to tag him in posts on X, he generally doesn’t put much stock into the public comments directed at him.           “It’s par for the course when you’re a public figure,” Sterling told Floyd’s attorney when he asked if his client’s posts are “threatening and intimidating” to him.           State witness Von DuBose, who represents Ruby Freeman, a witness in the racketeering case, said that social media posts about his client have caused her to take some precautions, including relocating from her home.           He said that Floyd’s posts about Freeman have led to a “spike” in online activity targeting Freeman.           “This is the beginning of potential threats,” he said, adding that their concerns resulted in them taking more security precautions for Freeman.

politics,"US fires on and kills hostile forces, launches precision airstrikes after attack in Iraq",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/us-attack-iraq/index.html,"       ﻿The US military has taken a number of retaliatory actions after multiple close-range ballistic missiles were launched against US and coalition forces at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq on Monday evening.           A US military aircraft – an AC-130 gunship – had responded immediately to the attack, firing on a vehicle and killing a yet unknown hostile forces, a US official told CNN on Tuesday. Later in the day, US Central Command announced that the US had also launched precision airstrikes on two facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in Iraq.           Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday that the attack by Iranian-backed militants resulted in “several non-serious injuries and some minor damage to infrastructure.” It marked, according to Singh, the first time that a ballistic missile was used since attacks on US and coalition forces began on October 17.           Two US officials said the US AC-130 gunship, which is capable of firing artillery at ground-based targets, was acting in defense.           US Central Command said Tuesday evening that the airstrikes were “in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups, including the one in Iraq on November 21, which involved use of close-range ballistic missiles.”           A defense official added that the facilities – an operations center and command and control node near Al Anbar and Jurf al Saqr, Iraq, south of Baghdad – were used by Kataib Hezbollah to “support recent attacks on US and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria.”           “Initial evaluation of the strikes indicate that US forces successfully destroyed the intended facilities. Additionally, we can confirm the presence of Kataib Hezbollah personnel,” the official said. “We’re unable to provide a casualty assessment at this time.”           While the strikes are the first in Iraq since attacks on US and coalition forces began, they are the fourth US strike against targets associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps since the attacks started on October 17.           The first strike occurred on October 26 when an F-15 fighter and two F-16 fighter jets targeted two weapons and ammunition storage facilities in Abu Kamal, Syria. Then on November 8, two F-15s carried out an airstrike on a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria. On November 12, the US carried out more airstrikes on a training facility and a safe house affiliated with the IRGC.           As of Tuesday there have been at least 66 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, including several on forces at Al-Asad. Earlier in the day on Monday before the ballistic missile attack, a US official said a one-way drone attack was also launched against forces at Al-Asad, which resulted in no casualties or infrastructure damage.           As of last week, at least 56 US troops had sustained minor injuries in the attacks since October 17 — at least 25 of them being traumatic brain injuries — and all had since returned to duty.           It’s unclear if an AC-130 has been used to respond to attacks in this way since October 17, though a US official said the US has returned fire on hostile forces multiple times.           “We have had other cases where we have responded in retaliation when we were able to identify the point of origin,” Singh said.           The attacks on US and coalition forces started after Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the Pentagon has maintained that the US has been successful in deterring any escalatory actions that would expand the conflict outside of Israel and Gaza despite the continued attacks on US forces.           “Is deterrence working? We feel that it is,” Singh told reporters last week. “We have not seen this war spread into a wider regional conflict. We have … conducted three different strikes. We responded most recently this weekend. And again, we will always reserve the right to respond at a time and place of our choosing in the future.”     This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.   © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,University of Tampa is the seventh college facing a Department of Education investigation in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/university-tampa-israel-war-investigation/index.html,"       The University of Tampa and a Florida school district, Hillsborough County Schools, are the latest schools to face an investigation by the Department of Education related to alleged incidents of discrimination.           The investigations were made public Tuesday by the department, which added them to an online list of ongoing investigations – which is growing in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. It also announced a second investigation into New York’s Columbia University.           Last week, the Department of Education launched investigations into six colleges – including Columbia, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania – and one K-12 school over alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia.           The investigations were launched by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, universities and K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide all students with an environment free from discrimination. Any person or organization can file a Title VI complaint with the Office for Civil Rights.           The agency is now conducting an unprecedented number of hate investigations, according to a department official.           The situation is becoming untenable for the Office for Civil Rights, which the official told CNN doesn’t have the investigative staff to match the influx of cases.           “Seeing the proliferation of hate on school campuses, we find it astonishing and scary,” the official said.           The Office for Civil Rights has now opened a total of 27 Title VI investigations this year. Fifteen similar investigations were opened last year and just two were opened in 2021. The office also investigates other kinds of rights violations, including those regarding sexual harassment.           “They (the Department of Education) are very clearly trying to demonstrate that they are moving quickly to respond to concerns they’ve heard from the public, from Congress and from the administration,” said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations and national engagement at the American Council on Education. The organization represents more than 1,700 colleges and universities.           “They have made it clear that they are going to be taking a very, very vigilant role on the issue of antisemitism on college campuses,” he added.           The Office for Civil Rights aims to resolve investigations within six months. Schools could ultimately lose federal funding if they don’t comply with the office’s recommendations, but investigations typically end with the school agreeing to address the incident or making policy changes if there is a systemic problem.           The University of Tampa said that the investigation stems from an incident that occurred in September – before the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel – and was addressed by the university.           “The university is fully cooperating with the request for information, but cannot comment further due to student privacy laws,” it said.           Columbia University said it would cooperate with any investigation. Hillsborough County Schools did not immediately respond to requests for comment.           College campuses have seen a rise in tension over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. A Cornell University student was federally charged in connection with a series of online posts threatening to kill and harm Jewish students, and the University of Pennsylvania recently alerted the FBI to a series of threatening, antisemitic emails sent to the Ivy League school’s staff.           Complaints filed earlier this month by the Brandeis Center, a Jewish civil rights legal organization, led the Office for Civil Rights to open investigations into the University of Pennsylvania and Wellesley College in Massachusetts.           Kenneth Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center, told CNN he thinks the Office for Civil Rights could be doing more. He also headed the office under the Trump administration.           “It’s just a drop in the bucket when you compare the number of investigations to the number of incidents we’re seeing across the country,” Marcus said.           “This reflects only a tiny percentage of problems out there,” he added.           Earlier this month, the Department of Education issued guidance to colleges and K-12 schools, reminding them that they have a legal obligation to address incidents of discrimination – including against those who are Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab or Palestinian.           The department also recently updated its discrimination complaint form, specifying that Title VI’s protection from discrimination based on race, color or national origin extends to students who are or are perceived to be Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or Sikh, or based on other shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

politics,Colorado Supreme Court to hear appeals in 14th Amendment challenge to Trump’s candidacy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/trump-critics-appeal-colorado-ruling/index.html,"       The Colorado Supreme Court has agreed to hear appeals in a 14th Amendment challenge to former President Donald Trump’s candidacy and scheduled oral arguments for December 6.           Trump’s team and the group trying to remove him from the Colorado ballot based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” appealed different parts of last week’s lower-court ruling, which found that Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but that the ban doesn’t apply to the presidency.           Many experts believe the case, which was brought by Republican and independent voters in coordination with a liberal-leaning watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, will eventually reach the US Supreme Court in some fashion.     Takeaways from the blockbuster Trump ‘insurrectionist ban’ ruling         Colorado District Court Judge Sarah Wallace issued a stunning 102-page decision Friday, that found Trump “engaged in an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, but concluded that the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” doesn’t apply to presidents, based on the text of the amendment, which was ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War.           It says American officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are banned from future office if they “engaged in insurrection.” The provision explicitly bans insurrectionists from serving as US senators, representatives and even presidential electors – but it does not say anything about the presidency. It says it covers “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” and Wallace ruled that this does not include the office of the presidency.           That key finding is what the anti-Trump challengers hope the Colorado Supreme Court will overturn.           “No court should adopt an interpretation of the Constitution that has such absurd results,” the challengers wrote in their appeal filing. “Fortunately, in this case, the text and history all comport with the common-sense outcome. Section 3 does not disqualify oath-breaking insurrectionists from nearly all public offices except the highest one, nor does it give a unique free pass to insurrectionist Presidents.”           All seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic governors. Six of the seven subsequently won statewide retention elections to stay on the bench. The seventh was only appointed in 2021 and hasn’t faced voters yet.           Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the anti-Trump challengers, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday that he was “hopeful” his appeal will prevail in overturning the “one issue” that the judge “got wrong” about who the ban does – and doesn’t – apply to.           “We’re going to pursue our claims in court. I think we put on a very good case, the judge issued a very detailed and thorough opinion – it took until page 95 of a 102-page opinion for her to rule against us on anything, so we’re just going to continue forward. We’re going to go to the Colorado Supreme Court and see what happens there.”           In other portions of Wallace’s ruling, she offered a searing condemnation of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. She concluded that the former president “actively primed the anger of his extremist supporters” and “acted with the specific intent to incite political violence and direct it at the Capitol.”           Trump has prevailed in similar constitutional challenges in several states, including Michigan and Minnesota, though other appeals are underway.           “It was an outrageous attempt at disenfranchising millions and millions of voters by getting us thrown off the ballot,” Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Iowa. “We’ve now beat the radical Democrats’ election-rigging ballot qualification scam in Colorado and Michigan and Minnesota and New Hampshire and other states.”           Trump also has appealed the decision, taking issue with several of the judge’s findings, including that he “engaged” in the January 6 insurrection.           Trump’s lawyers say Wallace reached the “correct” conclusion that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to presidents.           However, they asked the Colorado Supreme Court to overturn her other decisions, arguing she “committed multiple grave jurisdictional and legal errors … creating new, unprecedented, and unsupported legal standards in applying” the constitutional disqualification clause.           The lawyers said in a court filing that they want these matters corrected now because of the possibility of “further review” in the case, referring to the widely expected eventual appeals to the Supreme Court.

politics,Iowa evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats endorses DeSantis’ presidential bid,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/bob-vander-plaats-endorsement-desantis/index.html," Bob Vander Plaats, a key evangelical leader in Iowa, officially announced his endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday.           “I’m thrilled to throw my personal endorsement and support behind Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida,” he said in a Fox News interview.           Vander Plaats, the CEO and President of The Family Leader, has clashed with former President Donald Trump and urged Republicans to move on from the former president while heaping praise on DeSantis. A longtime GOP powerbroker, he has thrown his weight behind the eventual winner of the past three Iowa caucuses not to feature an incumbent Republican president.           Vander Plaats said he had leaned toward DeSantis from the outset of the primary due to his strong performance in the 2022 midterm elections, winning Florida by a sizable margin while Republicans around the country largely underperformed expectations. But he said DeSantis “closed the sale” during his appearance at The Family Leader’s Thanksgiving Family Forum event in Iowa last week.           “He was very clear about, we need a president who can serve two terms, not one term. We don’t need a president that’s gonna be a lame duck on day one,” Vander Plaats said.           In a tweet, DeSantis thanked Vander Plaats for his endorsement, characterizing support from the Christian leader as a sign that Iowa evangelicals “can trust me to fight and win for them.”           “As I’ve made my way through 98 of Iowa’s 99 counties, Iowans have shared what a critical role @bobvanderplaats plays in engaging Iowa’s faith community in the key battles that matter. His support tells Iowans they can trust me to fight and win for them,” he wrote in a social media post.           The backing from Vander Plaats comes after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds endorsed DeSantis as the Florida governor has focused his campaign’s strategy on Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses. He previously said that he has discussed a possible endorsement with Reynolds.           Vander Plaats told Fox that he believes his endorsement, combined with the endorsement from Reynolds, could propel DeSantis to success in Iowa, and speculated it could give him momentum in subsequent primaries.           “I think Gov. Reynolds’ endorsement of Ron DeSantis is a key play in the state of Iowa. And if Iowa launches a Ron DeSantis, I think it gives New Hampshire a new look, South Carolina new look, and you have a real primary that’s going to take place,” he said.     News Nation was first to report the news of the expected endorsement.           On the same day as Vander Plaats’ expected announcement, Trump’s campaign said that more than 150 faith leaders in Iowa had backed the former president.           “This announcement is not just a number; it’s a powerful message that faith communities trust President Trump to lead our nation forward with integrity and moral clarity,” Dan McCoy, senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Urbandale, Iowa, said in a news release from the campaign.           Vander Plaats said he believes the Republican primary is a “two-person race” between DeSantis and Trump and acknowledged that the former president winning the Iowa caucuses would put him in a strong position to become the eventual nominee. But he said he believes the state is “tailor-made” for DeSantis to win.           “If President Trump wins Iowa here, I think it’s going to be awfully hard to make the case that you can beat President Trump, and he’s gonna be your eventual nominee,” he said. “But I think America would be well served to have a choice, and I really believe Ron DeSantis is that guy and I think Iowa’s tailor-made for him to win this.”     This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,House Judiciary GOP subpoenas assistant US attorney involved in Hunter Biden probe,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/house-gop-subpoena-hunter-biden-case/index.html,"       The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed an assistant US attorney on the Hunter Biden criminal case, according to a copy of the subpoena reviewed by CNN.           House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan initially requested testimony from Assistant US Attorney Lesley Wolf in June along with a number of Justice Department officials involved in the Hunter Biden criminal investigation. The Department of Justice has made six high-level officials, including special counsel David Weiss, available to testify, but has not allowed the panel to interview Wolf.           In the subpoena letter, Jordan called the DOJ’s reasons for withholding Wolf’s testimony “unpersuasive.” DOJ declined to comment to CNN on the subpoena.          Whistleblowers with the Internal Revenue Service have told Congress they believe that Wolf deviated from protocol on several occasions throughout the case and stymied their efforts to obtain subpoenas and search warrants, allegations that Republicans have seized on.           During his closed-door interview with Congress earlier this month, Weiss defended Wolf.           “From my perspective, the prosecutors who participated in this case followed the law and the facts, that was the motivation,” Weiss said, adding that Wolf is a “dedicated public servant for more than 16 years,” an “excellent lawyer” and “a person of integrity.”           Republicans have set December 7 as Wolf’s deposition date.           Jordan argues that Wolf’s testimony is also relevant to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, and previously told CNN she was one of the individuals he wanted to interview before he could wrap up his part of the inquiry.           “Given your critical role you played in the investigation of Hunter Biden, you are uniquely situated to shed light on whether President Biden played any role in the Department’s investigation and whether he attempted, in any way, to directly or indirectly obstruct either that investigation or our investigation,” Jordan wrote.

politics,Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/israel-hamas-qatar-hostage-agreement-analysis/index.html,"       The Gaza hostage deal represents a rare moment of humanity in a savage conflict that has inflicted unfathomable violence on both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.           For the child and female hostages expected to be released during a pause in the fighting and their families, it represents everything — a chance of life seven weeks after a Hamas terror attack on Israeli soil slaughtered 1,200 people.           There were growing hopes, for example, on Tuesday night that American Avigail Idan, who turns four on Friday and whose mother and father were murdered in the attacks on October 7, could be among the first released.           “I am very hopeful, our family is hopeful, it’s been 45 days since (Avigail) was abducted and taken to Gaza,” her great aunt Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “It’s excruciating. For our family, we have spent the last seven weeks – seven weeks – worrying, wondering, praying, hoping.”     Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages         The hours to come will be agonizing for loved ones waiting for their relatives – and even more so for those whose family members are not on the list to be freed in this preliminary arrangement. Much remains uncertain, including when the pause will start, how and when hostages will start to emerge and if the agreement will last.           The complex agreement was brokered by Qatar, which served as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel in exhaustive negotiations with the close involvement of the United States, and was endorsed by the Israeli cabinet early Wednesday local time.           It will likely require similar attention from all involved to implement in a vicious war zone and it will be at risk of unravelling at any moment. This is because of a vacuum of trust between two bitter enemies and the extreme logistical challenges of extracting hostages from a territory that waited weeks for the arrival of a few aid trucks amid a raging Israeli offensive.           The carefully choreographed plan would see the release of at least 50 women and children held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for a four-day truce in Israel’s air and ground campaign against the Islamist group, an Israel government statement said. The announcement also held out the potential for the truce to extend beyond the original four-day period, given that an extra day could be added for each 10 additional hostages available for release. Hamas said in a statement that 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails.           Nothing is certain until the hostages start coming out. And the sequencing of the agreement means there will be a constant risk of incidents that could disrupt it.           But the weeks of negotiations at least proved that intense diplomatic efforts can accomplish something concrete, even if the agreement is far from the ceasefire that Israel’s critics are demanding internationally after a conflict that produced harrowing scenes of Israeli kids killed in their beds and Palestinian hospitals under Israeli fire.           The deal is the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the Hamas attacks, and may temporarily ease some of the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose legacy will now be forever tarnished by October 7.           The White House will greet the deal as a significant victory and a first success after weeks of painstaking personal engagement by President Joe Biden and top foreign policy and intelligence officials that threatened to go nowhere. Biden held multiple phone calls with Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. His envoy, Brett McGurk, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were intimately involved in the region. The Israeli leader said Tuesday that the president had been responsible for improving the deal at critical moments.           The agreement, even if it fully delivers on its potential, is unlikely to permanently ease Netanyahu’s tenuous political plight. He’s trapped between the extreme right-wing coalition members he chose as a last resort to cling to power and an Israeli public that blames him for the Hamas attacks. And Biden has already absorbed considerable domestic political damage for his steadfast support for the Israeli response. Heart-rending video of civilian carnage in Gaza has caused some young and Arab American voters in the Democratic base to revolt, furthering weakening Biden’s shaky electoral coalition with his reelection race heating up.           The impending hostage release deal is also the latest example of Qatar’s capacity to play on all sides of a treacherous regional power game. Home to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the oil rich Arab nation also hosts a vast US air base that is critical to American national security – a duality that reflects the Emirate’s emerging role as a Middle Eastern power with wider aspirations.           There will be some hope that the agreement, if honored by both sides, could lead to further breakthroughs and improve the prospects for more hostages still captive in Gaza. Their continued incarceration – presumably in dark tunnels beneath the war-torn enclave – tempered the sense of euphoria about those who are expected to be freed.           The first step for the precarious agreement will be gathering the hostages and facilitating their transfer and initiating the pause in fighting and the entry into Gaza of humanitarian aid under the deal. The potential for snags is ever present. As Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli peace activist who once acted as a channel to Hamas, put it on Tuesday: “You have to remember Israel is negotiating with people who it intends to kill — there is no trust between the parties.”           The hostage breakthrough – and the expected release of a fraction of those captured by Hamas on October 7 – raises the question of what happens to those left behind. The answer will be tough for their loved ones to hear.           “If it took this long to get women and children out, what does it look like for the Israeli soldiers that are being held?” said Christopher O’Leary, a former US government director of hostage recovery. “It could be a very protracted period that they are held, which is why going back on offensive military operations after this tactical pause is going to be required,” O’Leary told CNN International’s Richard Quest.           Even so, international expectations might subtly shift during the truce, making a resumption of Israel’s offensive harder than Netanyahu might wish.           Longer term, hopes that a broader peace initiative could grow from this small first step risk being undercut by the searing reality of the conflict.           Israel believes it is fighting an existential war not just for its national survival but for that of the Jewish people. Hamas fighters in Gaza are fighting against obliteration or embracing martyrdom and while the group’s leaders might seek to leverage remaining hostages for thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails, the most likely scenario is a fight to the finish in Gaza after the pause ends. This would inevitably mean new Israel Defense Force advances on Palestinian population centers and more deaths among trapped civilians that will further exacerbate the brittle international situation inside Israel, the US and elsewhere.           “There is no scenario to end this war without Israel making sure Hamas is no longer in control of their territory. That means killing all their operatives and their leaders, their political and military leaders,” Baskin told CNN Max.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Trump’s gag order appeal previews America’s grave election year stress test,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/trump-gag-order-appeal-election-year-stress-test/index.html,"       Donald Trump may have found his “heads-I-win, tails-you-lose” legal challenge.           However the ex-president’s appeal ends against a limited gag order imposed in his federal election subversion case, he can expect a benefit. If Trump prevails – or the three judges who heard the case Monday narrow the terms of the restriction – he may gain new leeway to attack special counsel Jack Smith’s case against him. If Trump loses, as seems likely given the tone of the hearing, he will have a new talking point for his narrative that he’s being persecuted to destroy his 2024 campaign.     Takeaways from the tense appeals court hearing over the Trump gag order in federal election subversion case         A judgment in Trump’s favor on the gag order – which has been temporarily frozen while the appeal is heard – would pale against his four criminal trials and his current civil fraud trial in New York.           But the issue, and Monday’s hearing, provided a preview of the extreme institutional stress, political tensions and grave constitutional questions ahead next year when the most recent president and possible GOP nominee fights for his liberty in multiple courtrooms while battling to win back the White House.           It’s hard to see how the legal system escapes the fate of other institutions of accountability whose images have been tarnished after seeking to contain or expose the ex-president’s unique brand of rule breaking.           The gag order appeal is entwined with complex arguments on the breadth of the First Amendment and the extent to which courts have the right to regulate its scope in order to protect their officers and proceedings and the administration of justice.           The takeaway from Monday’s arguments was that the three judges – all appointed by Democrats – appear likely to largely restore the limited gag order on Trump imposed by Judge Tanya Chutkan. The restrictions prevented Trump from attacking court staff, prosecutors or potential witnesses verbally or on social media. But they didn’t stop him from venting about the judge, the Justice Department, the case more generally or his potential general election foe, President Joe Biden.           Trump’s legal team argued that any restrictions on his comments represent an unconstitutional assault on his rights to freedom of political speech. But the judges must decide the extent to which those rights can be curtailed for a criminal defendant — who in this case allegedly attempted to thwart the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and maintained no wrongdoing in all of the cases against him.           The case is complicated by the fact that Trump’s lambasting of Smith as “a lunatic,” for example, is more serious than just whining over his treatment. It fits into a long-term effort to delegitimize the justice system itself. DC Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett made this point when she told Trump’s counsel, D. John Sauer, that labeling all of Trump’s utterances “‘core political speech’ begs the question of whether it is in fact political speech, or whether it is political speech aimed at derailing or corrupting the criminal justice process.”           Trump’s legal arguments also appear to be touching on another vital question: does his status as a politician offers him an extra layer of protection? His lawyers argued that the restrictions were even more unjustified given that they were imposed during “a hotly contested campaign for the highest office in the United States of America.” This presents the judges with a tough balancing act in a case that does not just bear on the capacity of courts to protect fair trials but also touches on the integrity of the electoral system.           An overly restrictive order could hamper Trump’s capacity to repel political attacks against his candidacy – especially since his campaign is so intertwined with his legal fight. And the decision the judges make could echo for years to come and affect future political candidates. But at the same time, the implication that a political candidate could be allowed to intimidate witnesses on social media in a manner that a regular citizen would not raises another perennial question in Trump’s legal cases – of equality under the law and whether he’s seeking special treatment simply because of who he is.           “There are many legal questions we have talked about in the context of Donald Trump over the years (and) nothing is harder for judges to sort out than the First Amendment and these free speech issues,” said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst. “At some point, a judge has to step in and almost arbitrarily decide what is okay and what isn’t. They were clearly grappling with this over hours and hours.”           Given the tightrope the judges are walking, it’s hard to see how these questions can be fully answered without some ensuing damage to US institutions. But Trump’s willingness to open them shows that, as usual, he’s content to put his political goals over America’s democratic foundation.           Trump’s incessant assaults on the judicial process reflect another never-before-seen aspect of a presidential election campaign, which loomed over Monday’s hearing. Because he could be tied up with criminal trials for much of the next year, Trump wants every opportunity to use the legal system as a platform for a political fight. It also gives him a cause that resonates with his most loyal supporters – that he’s defending them from what he spins as a weaponized justice system.           The ex-president seems to view such a narrative — ideal for raking in campaign cash he’s partly using to pay his legal bills — as his best shot at creating anger among Republican voters that could help him win reelection. (A second presidency could also equip Trump with the capacity to delay or halt some of the federal cases against him.)           The ex-president is already seeking to use the courtroom as a political platform in the civil case against him, his adult sons and his company in New York. In his appearance on the witness stand two weeks ago, Trump infuriated Judge Arthur Engoron with lengthy and political answers to narrow evidential questions. “This is not a political rally. This is a courtroom,” Engoron said at one point.           The issue of the gag order in the federal election subversion case also sheds new light on a consistent concern about the impact of Trump’s rhetoric and the extent to which his statements could incite violence. This is, after all, a former president who told his supporters to “fight like Hell” for their country immediately before his mob smashed its way into the US Capitol and tried to halt certification of the election on January 6, 2021.           The possibility that Trump’s fierce attacks against potential witnesses, court staff and others could lead to actual harm, even if he is not explicit, seems very real. Only last week, a judge in Colorado argued that the ex-president “engaged in an insurrection” after the last election even while conceding she lacked the power to bar him from the primary ballot in the Rocky Mountain State.           The incitement issue is not a hypothetical one in the gag order case. Trump has already attacked former Vice President Mike Pence and the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, multiple times on social media. He even suggested that the recently retired top military officer be executed for treason. Both men could be key witnesses in the federal election subversion case and will therefore be entitled to the protection of the court — even if Trump may consider them fair game as political critics at a time when he’s locked in the heat of a political campaign.           History suggests that if Trump loses this appeal, he’ll both brand the outcome as proof of an attempt by the Biden Justice Department to persecute him and seek to elevate the case to a higher court. Given his transactional view of the legal system, he may reason he’d have better luck with the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But the top bench has not shown much interest in becoming embroiled in many of Trump’s most politicized cases.           “I don’t even think they will take it up. I will be very surprised if they do,” said Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, on CNN Max on Monday, adding that the Supreme Court is “not just your safety valve whenever you get a ruling that you don’t like.”           But Moss also suggested that the case will make “a great political talking point if they lose.”           That, after all, is the common thread behind many of Trump’s legal appeals, challenges and defenses.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,This may be Biden’s best hope of reversing his slide with Black and brown voters,https://edition.cnn.com/politics/joe-biden-minority-voters/index.html," President Joe Biden’s weakness in polls among non-White voters is boosting Republican hopes that the GOP is poised to extend its most important political breakthrough of modern times – and potentially to reshape the competition between the two parties along the way.           The most consequential political gain for Republicans in recent decades has been their increasing strength among working-class White voters – a process that began under Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in the 1970s and 1980s but peaked in recent years under Donald Trump. Once the brawny backbone of the Democrats’ “New Deal” coalition that dominated American politics from the 1930s until the 1960s, White voters without a college degree have become the foundation of the modern GOP.           Now some political observers believe working-class minority voters are moving along the same track – and largely for the same reasons. Just as millions of working-class White voters recoiled from Democratic cultural liberalism during the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s, they argue, working-class Latino and even Black voters are shifting toward the GOP now in rejection of “woke” ideology on issues such as crime, immigration and LGBTQ rights.           Such arguments are fueling the increasingly common assertions that Republicans are building a “multiracial populist coalition,” as GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini argues in his copiously researched recent book, “Party of the People.”           While “the rightward shift” of White- and non-White voters without a college degree toward the GOP in the Trump years “might seem like two discrete, unrelated events …the two groups share a common working-class DNA and their political shifts stem from the same root,” Ruffini writes.     Joe Biden is facing a near-historic deficit for an incumbent         A wide array of recent polls shows Biden with an unusually small lead for a Democrat among both Black and Latino voters in a potential 2024 rematch with Trump. But many analysts say it’s less clear that Democrats are facing a lasting structural realignment among those voters – much less a change rooted in a long-term cultural alienation from the party – rather than immediate dissatisfaction with the economy under Biden.           “I keep looking for it as well, but you are not seeing as much evidence for a culture war driving any kind of change at this moment,” said Carlos Odio, senior vice president for research at Equis Research, a Democratic polling firm that specializes in Latino voters. “What’s driving Trump and the Republicans is the economy. At the end of the day, ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ over and over again.”           If anything, rather than cultural alienation driving working-class non-White voters toward the GOP, continuing resistance in those communities to Republican priorities on many culturally and racially tinged issues may be Democrats’ best hope in 2024 of recapturing non-White voters disenchanted with Biden’s performance and the economy. Despite all the discontent over Biden, almost three-fifths of non-White voters without a college degree agreed that the “Republican Party has been taken over by racists,” in a recent national survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, according to previously unpublished results provided to CNN.           The stakes in this struggle are enormous. White voters without a college degree, now the electorate’s most Republican-leaning group, have been steadily shrinking as a share of the total vote at a rate of about 2 to 3 percentage points in each presidential election for decades. To offset that decline, Republicans need to find votes elsewhere. The party is facing resistance among college-educated White voters, many of whom have recoiled from the hard-edged cultural and racial views the party has embraced under Trump. To strategists like Ruffini, the most plausible path for the GOP to remain competitive over time is to grow its vote among non-White voters, especially those without college degrees.           “With the Republicans’ strongest group” of White voters without a college degree “shrinking and their weakest set of groups growing, Republicans will need to increase their support levels across all parts of the multiracial populist coalition just to keep pace with where they are today,” Ruffini writes in his engaging new book.           All data sources about voting behavior agree that the GOP has improved its performance among minority voters without a college degree over the past decade. For many observers perhaps the most surprising result in the 2020 election was Trump’s improvement among those voters after four years in which he frequently appealed to White racial resentments and pursued militant immigration policies, such as separating children from their parents at the border.           The exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that Trump’s vote among non-White voters without a college degree increased from just 20% in 2016 to 26% in 2020. Research by Catalist, a Democratic voter targeting firm whose analyses are respected in both parties, found that Trump’s vote among Latino voters without a college degree spiked from 61% in 2016 to 72% in 2020; Trump also enjoyed a modest 3 percentage point gain among Black voters without a college degree over that period, Catalist found.           Exactly why Trump made those gains, though, remains a matter of dispute – with important implications for 2024 and beyond. Advocates of the realignment theory argue that Trump’s gains represented an ideological rejection of Democrats among centrist and right-leaning minority voters, prompted partly by their opposition to the calls to “defund the police” in the racial justice protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. They pointed to evidence in exit polls that a much higher percentage of minority voters who identified as conservative voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016.           But many others, such as Odio, believe Trump’s 2020 non-White improvement was grounded in the belief that he was more qualified to run the economy. Those in this camp believe the key factor for many working-class minority voters was Trump’s determination to quickly reopen the economy after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.           Somewhat to the surprise of both parties, the movement of non-college-educated minority voters toward the GOP stalled in the 2022 midterm election, even though those voters expressed widespread disenchantment with the economy and Biden’s performance. In Catalist’s analysis, Democrats won a slightly higher percentage of Latinos without a college degree in the 2022 House races than they did in the 2020 presidential contest. Most important for Democrats, Senate incumbents Mark Kelly in Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada – probably the two states where Latino voters are most important for the party – also ran slightly better among non-college-educated Latinos than Biden did in their states, according to previously unpublished Catalist results provided to CNN. (The exit polls, differing slightly, showed a small further national gain in 2022 for the GOP among non-White voters without a college degree.)           Odio, though, warns that Democrats can only take so much comfort from their 2022 success among minority voters, particularly those without college degrees. The reason, he says, is that the openness toward Trump and the GOP has been most pronounced among economically marginal Latino voters who are largely disconnected from the political system and much less likely to turn out in a midterm than presidential year election. “So much of the dynamism and volatility in the Latino vote is among less frequent voters,” Odio said. “So in important ways, you almost have to clear 2022 out of your mind.” Some Democratic strategists who focus on Black voters believe the same is true in that community.           The swarm of recent polls showing Biden leading Trump only narrowly with Latino and Black voters has prompted a new wave of concern about the party’s position in minority communities. Especially ominous for Democrats is the large share of both Latino and Black voters in multiple polls who say Biden’s economic policies have not helped them and/or say they trust Trump more than Biden to manage the economy.           Daron Shaw, a Republican pollster and University of Texas political scientist who co-conducted a recent large national survey of Latino voters for Univision, says that those attitudes mean “there is absolutely an opening” for Trump or another GOP nominee to advance further with non-White voters in 2024. Just as many White working-class voters “felt like the financial crisis of ’08-‘09 left them rudderless [and] eroded their position in American society … both on economic grounds and on cultural grounds, there are voters within the Latino community as well, who feel no one is representing them,” Shaw said during a press call about the Univision poll.           The risk to Democrats, Shaw argued, is that some of those working-class Latino voters believe the party is distracted by what he sees as cultural causes, such as LGBTQ rights, and “is not as interested” in their bread-and-butter economic concerns “as they have been” previously.           Sergio Garcia-Rios, a University of Texas political scientist who partnered with Shaw on the Univision poll, said the Latinos supporting Trump are drawn to him mostly on economic grounds. “To those who are voting for Trump, they remember that in 2016-’17-‘18 the economy worked better,” he said. “You and I can disagree with them on whether or not that is true. But that’s what they remember.”           Several grassroots organizers who work in minority communities told me that their experience in 2022 demonstrated that Democrats can win an economic argument even among minority voters who feel squeezed by the cost of living under Biden. Melissa Morales, founder and president of Somos Votantes, a group that mobilizes Latino voters, said Cortez Masto’s victory last year showed that Democrats can survive discontent about the economy if they convince voters they are pursuing policies to help them make ends meet.           The key for Biden, she said, is to show Latinos, “‘Here’s what I am doing to try to make this better. We are creating better jobs, I am working actively to lower prices.’ If Biden can present that to voters, there is still an opening here. The fact that costs are high isn’t the end game – it’s what are you going to do about that that voters are looking for.”           Similarly, Matt Morrison – executive director of Working America, a group that politically organizes working-class voters who are not in unions – said the organization’s experience in 2022 showed that there remains “a critical difference” between White and non-White voters without a college degree.           In the group’s door-to-door or phone canvassing efforts, he said, they’ve typically had far more success moving working-class Black and Latino voters to support Democratic candidates around an economic message than they have at persuading White voters at similar education and income levels. Even when organizers can win an economic argument with working-class White voters, he said, those voters often still remain dubious of Democrats because they believe the party favors minorities. That second barrier doesn’t exist with voters of color, Morrison said. “When you communicate to Black and brown voters, they are far more likely to come back to Democrats,” Morrison said. “They lack that social glue that makes them say, ‘I am of a different tribe.’”           Even so, the depth of discontent about the economy among minority voters is likely to remain a crucial hurdle for Biden. Democrats are accustomed to winning at least 7 in 10 minority voters in presidential elections; even if inflation continues to subside, it seems highly unlikely by Election Day that 7 in 10 minority voters will put more faith in Biden than a Republican to manage the economy.           That means if Biden is to match, or even approach, Democrats’ historic performance among minority voters, he’ll need other issues to convert some who are dubious about his economic record. And resistance to the GOP’s priorities on cultural and racially tinged issues probably offers him the best opportunity.           Those who assert that minorities are abandoning the Democratic Party on cultural grounds often point to the large share of non-White voters who express broad views about US society more often associated with Republicans. Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic electoral analyst who has become an unflinching critic of the party’s policies on social issues, has noted, for instance, that most Latinos agree with statements asserting the US is the greatest country in the world and reject the idea that racism is embedded in American institutions. “It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Democrats’ emphasis on social and democracy issues, while catnip to some socially liberal, educated voters, leaves many working-class and Hispanic voters cold,” writes Teixeira, co-author of the recent book, “Where Have All The Democrats Gone?,” which makes similar arguments as Ruffini.           Yet as polling by the Public Religion Research Institute, Univision and other groups show, on many of the actual cultural policies dominating political debate, most minority voters – including most of those without a college degree – align with Democrats, not Republicans. Among non-White voters without a college degree, 57% support legal abortion, 55% back same sex-marriage, and 64% oppose placing barriers at the US border to deter migrants, according to unpublished results from the PRRI’s latest national American Values Survey provided to CNN. (Support for Democratic positions is even greater among non-White voters with a college degree, PRRI found.) Other surveys have found preponderant support among minorities for banning assault weapons and lopsided opposition to ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, as Trump and other GOP candidates have proposed.           Maybe most significantly, in PRRI polling, about three-fifths of non-White voters without a college degree agree the GOP has been “taken over by racists,” as do nearly two-thirds of non-White voters with a degree. By contrast, three-fifths of White voters without a college degree reject that idea.     Trump plots mass detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants should he regain power         Analysts like Odio believe one reason Trump improved among Latinos in 2020 was that he downplayed the harsh language about immigration he used in 2016 and instead emphasized his economic agenda. But Trump has again moved sharply to the right on immigration, pledging mass deportations, internment camps for migrants, the end of birthright citizenship, and military action against Mexico to fight drug cartels. He’s also refused to rule out reinstating his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border.           Latinos in the key states may not yet be aware of Trump’s immigration plans. But Robert P. Jones, president and founder of PRRI, said the group’s polling convinces him that Trump’s agenda on immigration and other cultural issues will ultimately repel some Latino voters otherwise disenchanted with Biden on the economy. “I think we will not know the truth about how much they [Republicans] are overplaying their hand until next summer” if Trump becomes the GOP nominee, Jones said.           Some expressions of cultural liberalism – such as the fleeting calls in 2020 to “defund the police” – have clearly rankled working-class minority voters. But Biden never endorsed that idea. And his clearest path to recovering with those voters may be to convince them that the Republican agenda on immigration and other cultural issues threatens their interests and values. Rather than driving further movement toward the GOP among minority voters, in other words, issues such as abortion or immigration may be Biden’s best hope of preventing slippage with those voters.           Odio says that in Equis’ polling, the parties are in mirror-image positions with the Latino community. “Among Latinos, Democrats are seen as caring, but there are doubts about their ability to deliver,” he said. “The thought is Republicans might be better at delivering, but there’s an underlying fear they don’t care.”           Which side of that equation proves more compelling not only to Latino, but also to Black and other minority working-class voters, will go a long way toward determining whether Biden can win a second term.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Polling shows a huge age gap divides the Democratic Party on Israel,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/politics/polling-democrats-divided-israel-palestine/index.html,"       President Joe Biden has a problem with the Democratic base when it comes to the Israel-Hamas War. It’s not just that his approval rating on the conflict is lower among Democrats than his overall approval rating. It’s that his base is divided – by age.           Younger Democrats are far more likely than older Democrats to view Israel skeptically when it comes to this war as well as the larger geopolitical context. The intra-party age gaps on this question are amongst the largest I’ve ever seen on any important issue.           Take a look at a recent Quinnipiac University poll on the topic. Biden’s approval rating for his handling of the Israel-Hamas War among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters is just 56%. Compare that to his 76% approval rating among Democratic voters for his overall job performance.           A significant minority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters (36%) disapprove of his handling of the war. Those voters tend to be young.           The lion’s share (69%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning younger than 35 disapprove of how Biden is responding to the war. Just 24% approve. It’s the inverse among older Democrats. Most Democrats 65 and older (77%) approve of Biden on this issue. Few (16%) disapprove.           The cause of the split is pretty clear when you dig deeper into the data. Biden has been, by most neutral accounts, more sympathetic to Israel than Palestinians during the war. That doesn’t sit well with younger Democrats.           When asked which side they sympathize with, Israelis or Palestinians, more, Democrats younger than 35 are far more likely to sympathize with Palestinians (74%) than Israelis (16%). Democrats 65 and older are somewhat more likely to side with Israelis (45%) than Palestinians (25%).           The large divide by age causes Democrats and Democratic leaning voters overall to split basically evenly, with 39% sympathizing with Palestinians and 35% with Israelis.           This is a massive shift from the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, when Democrats were more likely to sympathize with Israel by a 48% to 22% margin. That poll was taken in the immediate aftermath of a surprise terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7 that killed about 1,200 people. Since that time, Israel has mounted an offensive in Gaza, and the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says more than 10,000 Palestinians have died.           The age breakdown that we’re seeing now, though, goes deeper than just this war or the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians. It comes down to whether Democrats see Israel as a partner.           Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters (70%) believe that supporting Israel is in the national interest. This includes 87% of those 65 and older.           Democrats younger than 35 see things entirely differently. Just 40% think backing Israel is in the national interest of this country. The majority (52%) disagree.           Perhaps not surprisingly, these younger Democrats don’t think we should be supplying military aid to Israel in its war with Hamas. A mere 21% agree that we should, while 77% are against it. Older Democrats are for it by a 53% to 32% margin.           In total, Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters were 49% in opposition to 44% in support.           Voters overall, on the other hand, are 53% in support to 39% opposed for more military aid for Israel.           Fissures like these are part of the reason why Biden would have a tough time politically shifting away from Israel. On every question Quinnipiac asked about the conflict, the feelings of the entire electorate were more in-line with the Israeli position (and that of older voters) than the other option given.           All voters by a 54% to 24% margin sympathized more with Israelis than Palestinians. Voters, including Democrats, Republicans and independents, by a 73% to 19% margin said backing Israel was in the national interest of America.           Biden’s problem is that he likely needs more support from younger voters heading into the 2024 election. He won voters younger than 35 by more than 20 points in 2020. Today, his lead over former President Donald Trump is in the low single digits in an average of recent polling ahead of a potential rematch.           It’s not clear that Biden’s handling of the war is causing his decreased backing from younger voters, but it can’t be helping him.           The bottom line is Biden finds himself in a political quandary. You can add this to his growing list of problems, as he is only the second incumbent president in the last 80 years to be trailing at this point before the next presidential election. The other is the man he beat three years ago – Trump.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
politics,Haley and DeSantis still can’t solve their Trump problem as time runs short in GOP race,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/politics/haley-desantis-trump-problem/index.html,"       A weekend of ferocious political exchanges laid out the tumultuous reality of the 2024 White House campaign less than a year from Election Day.           The fight for the GOP nomination is about far more than a horse race between candidates. Its outcome will decide whether the country faces an extraordinary general election – which one potential nominee, ex-President Donald Trump, would fight while facing multiple criminal trials and promising a presidency of retribution that could shake US democracy as never before.           Time is quickly ebbing for one of his distant Republican rivals to recast the race less than two months before voting begins. The weekend brought more evidence that other prominent candidates have yet to solve the core question of the GOP primary season: How to exploit Trump’s greatest general election weakness – his lawlessness and criminal exposure – without alienating GOP voters.     Haley says she disagrees with Trump’s ‘vermin’ remark         Just days after Trump was accused of echoing Nazi propaganda and as he firms up plans to use the presidency as a tool of personal vengeance, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley laid out her most strident criticism of Trump yet. But her euphemistic language only highlighted her political dilemma and underscored Trump’s dominance of the primary.           Haley said in Iowa that she didn’t agree with Trump’s recent comments referring to political opponents as “vermin,” which had drawn Nazi analogies from the White House and some other critics of the ex-president. She also tried to allude to the potential uproar of a second Trump term without referring to the ex-president’s coming criminal trials or his attempt to subvert the will of voters by staying in power after he lost the 2020 election.           “It’s the chaos of it all, right? I think he means well. But the chaos has got to stop,” said Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations. “So it’s not so much about Donald Trump and, yes, his personality is not my personality. And yes, he says things he shouldn’t say. We look so distracted right now. And when America’s distracted, the world is less safe.”           Another Trump rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is battling to save his campaign after coming fourth in a new CNN/University of New Hampshire poll of the first GOP primary state, tried a different attack on Trump – though, like Haley, he shied away from the ex-president’s most glaring history.     DeSantis argues Trump and Biden are too old for presidency         “The presidency’s not a job for an 80-year-old. … Donald Trump would actually be older on January 20, 2025, than Biden was on January 20, 2021,” DeSantis told CNN’s Jake Tapper of the 77-year-old GOP front-runner on “State of the Union” Sunday.           “The presidency is not a job for somebody that’s pushing 80 years old. I just think that that’s something that has been shown with Joe Biden. Father Time is undefeated. Donald Trump is not exempt from any of that,” DeSantis added. “I’m in the prime of my life. I go in Day 1. I will serve two terms, deliver big results, and get the country moving again.”           Such a prospect seems a long shot, however. After beginning his campaign tipped as the most dangerous Republican challenger to Trump, the Florida governor is now pinning his hopes on a high finish in Iowa to re-create faded momentum countrywide.           DeSantis hit on one of the ironies of the 2024 campaign as he tried to paint both potential party nominees with the same brush. Voters consistently tell pollsters that they want a choice other than a 2020 rematch between Biden, who turns 81 on Monday, and Trump. Despite significant reluctance from within their own parties, both men are likely to be the nominees.           The Florida governor did, however, make the sale with one Iowa voter who told him on Sunday that he appreciated his point about being able to serve two terms and that he had seen his interview on “State of the Union.” The voter, John Walker, told CNN’s Kit Maher that he still liked the ex-president but added: “I just think there’s a huge amount of uncertainty with Trump, and I don’t like that.” Walker went on: “I don’t like to be uncertain. We don’t know if he’s going to end up in jail.”           Still, both Haley and DeSantis know that millions of the ex-president’s supporters have bought into his false claims he won in 2020. And even voters who say at GOP campaign events that they are open to a different candidate often also comment that Trump’s criminal indictments are evidence of political persecution by the Biden administration.           There’s very little market for trying to take Trump down.           Candidates like former Vice President Mike Pence or former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – who have more openly criticized Trump over his alleged illegalities, including over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents – are either already out of the race or struggling to make a mark nationally. Haley and DeSantis are therefore seeking to preserve their viability by dodging around Trump’s transgressions. But they are failing to hold him to account in a way that might weaken his hold on the nominating race – a scenario that severely restricts their campaigns.           Trump this weekend underscored the extreme nature of his candidacy and how he has not moderated in nearly three years out of the White House. During a swing through Iowa, he slammed Haley and DeSantis with petty insults, blasted Biden as “stupid” and “incompetent” and warned he shouldn’t be running the country.           The ex-president’s untamed tongue is not just previewing what would likely be a turbulent second term; it is also getting him into trouble in his multiple court cases, resulting judges imposing gag orders.           On Monday, Trump’s legal team will argue to a Washington, DC, appeals court that one such order imposed in his federal election subversion criminal case is unconstitutional.           District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued the measure to stop Trump from targeting court officers, potential witnesses and special counsel Jack Smith and his staff, verbally and on social media. The ex-president claims the measure infringes his First Amendment rights and is an attempt to muzzle his presidential campaign.           The gag order, which has been temporarily frozen pending appeals, reflects an enduring reality about the ex-president that is likely to help define the 2024 campaign – his contempt for the rules and customs that govern politics and the legal system. A similar gag order in his New York civil fraud trial was recently lifted temporarily. The judge who issued it, Arthur Engoron, asked Trump’s lawyer at trial two weeks ago whether he could control his client, inadvertently putting his finger on this key point about the ex-president. No lawyer, White House staffer, campaign adviser, political party or institution has ever been able to curb Trump’s impulses. It’s what could make the coming election and his possible second presidency such a perilous proposition.           The ex-president is already itching to get on with a potential general election clash. In Iowa, he called on voters to give him such a blowout win in the caucuses in January that it would force rival primary candidates out of the race.           “We have to send a great signal and then maybe these people just say, ‘OK, it’s over now. It’s over.’ We got to end it. Because we have to focus on crooked Joe Biden and the Democrats,” Trump said in a speech in which fiercely criticized the president over his China policy after his meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.           Trump’s escalating assault comes as Democrats fret about recent polls showing that the former president is leading his successor in most of the key swing states that will decide the election. While Biden’s camp has said things will change when there is a clear contrast between the candidates (assuming Trump becomes the GOP nominee), there are signs that the president’s team is stepping up the pace of his campaign for reelection.           “We are turning up the heat and brightening the spotlight on exactly what it would look like if he’s allowed back in the White House,” a Biden campaign official told CNN’s Arlette Saenz of Trump.     ‘We are turning up the heat’: Biden sharpens critiques of Trump with a year to go until the election         In one example of his hardening tone, Biden seized on Trump’s dark rhetoric about immigration during a campaign fundraiser in San Francisco last week.           “Trump also recently talked about, quote, ‘the blood of America is being poisoned.’ … Again, echoes the same phrases used in Nazi Germany,” Biden said. “Folks, we can’t fail. We can’t fail to treat the threat that he poses.”           The ex-president, however, showed how he plans to make the Biden administration’s struggle to control crossings over the southern border the centerpiece of his potential general election campaign. He headed to Texas on Sunday and pocketed the endorsement of the Lone Star State’s governor, Greg Abbott, who warned the situation was creating a “terror threat” in the US. Trump argued that the United States was plagued by “the most unsecure border in the history, I believe, really, of the world.”           The vehemence of his remarks this weekend is a reminder that when the campaign heats up after Thanksgiving, Americans are in for one of the most divisive White House races of modern times.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Joe Biden is facing a near-historic deficit for an incumbent,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-2024/index.html,"       Electoral analysts, myself included, like to cover our behinds. We use words like “may” and “could” to make sure we don’t get too far ahead of ourselves – especially when examining polls of a potential 2024 general election matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.           But the truth is that Trump has a small but clear advantage over Biden right now. This makes Biden just the second president since scientific polling began to trail in his reelection bid at this point in the campaign.           Take a look at recent national surveys from CBS News/YouGov, CNN/SSRS, Fox News, Marquette University Law School and Quinnipiac University. All five are high-quality polls that meet CNN standards for publication.           All five give Trump an advantage of 2 to 4 points over Biden among registered or likely voters. On their own, none of these data points mean too much. Trump’s lead in all of them is within the margin of error. Averaged together, though, they paint a picture of an incumbent with a real problem.           Over the past 80 years, incumbents have, on average, led their eventual challengers by a little more than 10 points about a year out from the election. This includes nearly every incumbent for whom we have polling since Franklin Roosevelt in 1943.           It includes Barack Obama against Mitt Romney in November 2011. This is notable because a number of Democrats have tried to dismiss the current data showing Biden in trouble by saying that Obama had been behind at this point, too. That simply isn’t true.           In fact, the lone incumbent to be behind in the polls at this point is the man Biden succeeded and is likely to face again: Trump, who trailed Biden by about 10 points in November 2019.     How RFK Jr. could change the outcome of the 2024 election         That’s what makes Trump’s small polling edge right now so remarkable. He never had such an edge during the 2020 campaign. I’m not just talking about this point in the 2020 cycle. I’m talking about at any point. I’m also not just talking about a lead in the average. I’m talking about a lead in any national poll that meets CNN’s standards for publication over the entire 2020 cycle.           There have been 17 such surveys this cycle in which Trump scored a higher vote share than Biden.           The same is true in the swing states, where Trump has been ahead in at least one poll in states where he never led in 2020. These include Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania – all states that will be key in determining the next president.           The question, of course, is why is Biden having so much difficulty against a man he was able to defeat the last time.           It might be tempting to think that it’s because of a divide within the Democratic ranks. Specifically, that Biden is having issues with his party’s left wing, as reflected by the loud criticism of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.           I don’t see that in the numbers. For example, Biden leads Trump 96% to 2% among very liberal voters in the latest Quinnipiac poll. He’s up 95% to 5% among this group in Marquette’s survey.           These numbers are, if anything, better than how he performed in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center’s report on validated voters. Biden won very liberal voters 92% to 6%.           Biden’s biggest decline is actually in the middle. He was ahead by a mere 12 points among moderates in Quinnipiac’s poll and by 18 points in Marquette’s survey. Fox had him up by 5 points. CNN put the margin at 17 points.           The Pew report from 2020 had him winning this bloc by 28 points. The exit polls had him winning moderates by 30 points. On average, we’re talking about a 15-point swing away from Biden.     ‘We are turning up the heat’: Biden sharpens critiques of Trump with a year to go until the election         In fact, ideology is probably the wrong way to explain why voters are shifting away from the president.           It could be the economy, an issue on which Biden is trailing Trump. But voters also preferred Trump to Biden on the economy by the end of the 2020 campaign.           Probably the best explanation for Biden’s troubles that I can come up with is age. More than perhaps any other indicator, the question of whether Biden is too old to be president has changed the most from 2020.           Consider the New York Times/Siena College polls released earlier this month from the six closest states Biden won: Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan. A massive 71% of registered voters in those states said Biden was too old to be an effective president. A majority of every group listed in the crosstabs of the poll said so, including 51% of Democrats.           Back in 2020, half that percentage of registered voters (36%) said Biden was too old to be an effective president.           The fact that so many voters feel Biden is too old makes sense given that he is the oldest president ever.           Now, Biden could win this campaign if he can convince enough voters that his opponent is too old for the job as well. After all, Trump would also be the oldest president ever to win election.           Biden’s problem, though, is that a mere 39% of voters believe Trump is too old for the job.           If Biden is able to get that number up, don’t be surprised if the polls begin to shift. But if he can’t, Trump could become the first president since Grover Cleveland to be elected to nonconsecutive terms.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

politics,Protests encapsulate progressive angst that could imperil Biden’s 2024 campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/politics/democrats-israel-biden-2024/index.html,"       Israel could not have asked for a better friend than President Joe Biden.           In the anguished aftermath of the horror unleashed by Hamas on October 7, Biden grieved with Israelis as though he was one of them. As global anger mounted at the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza during Israel’s counter-attack against Hamas, Biden has been unequivocal on the Jewish state’s right to hit back.           But rising anger and splits inside the Democratic Party over the ferocity of Israel’s incursion into Gaza and the lack of a ceasefire are creating a volatile political mood inside the United States. Dissent and restiveness among younger voters, and Arab Americans especially, appears to be increasing political risk for Biden on the cusp of the election year. Those divides threaten to exacerbate his weaknesses within his own party, which may pose the biggest risk to his hopes of a second term.     Top House Democrats evacuated from DNC headquarters as police clash with protesters calling for Gaza ceasefire         Biden’s delicate political position has seen him tread a fine line. He pushed back at suggestions by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would somehow control Gaza after the war. He also said this week that hospitals “must be protected” in the Hamas-ruled enclave. And on Wednesday, he suggested violence in the Middle East would only end with a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Domestically, the president has also unveiled a strategy to tackle Islamophobia, amid concerns among some Democrats he could be vulnerable to losing support of Muslim Americans, especially in the critical swing state of Michigan in next year’s election. Amid an unprecedented upsurge of antisemitic incidents in the United States, especially on college campuses, the president also directed his administration to protect Jewish Americans.           But the longer the civilian carnage plays out in Gaza and as anger mounts among activists on the American left, questions will arise over Biden’s capacity to sustain his bedrock support for Israel’s military action. Senior administration officials have repeatedly denied that any part of Biden’s calculations on Israel are rooted in domestic politics. But Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that progressive anger over the war “has a potential” to hurt Biden politically. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN last week that the White House position on the Gaza war was also a problem for Biden among younger voters on whom Democrats often depend to drive up turnout. “I think it’s significant,” the New York Democrat said. “Young people have been paying attention to this issue.”           The issue is especially acute given the president’s weak political standing overall, as his reelection race heats up with polls showing that he’s shedding support from critical elements of the Democratic coalition.           New polling finds a rising share of the American public disapproving of Israel’s military response to the Hamas terrorist attack – especially Democrats and younger Americans. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, for example, 38% of Americans say Israel’s military response to the attack by Hamas has been “too much,” up from 26% in an October survey. More than half of Democrats feel that way and as do about half of voters under age 45.     Biden faces a warning sign from younger voters critical to his coalition         For now, Biden is showing no public sign that he’s feeling political heat. As recently as Wednesday, for instance, he defended Israel’s right to move on al-Shifa hospital in Gaza – an act that attracted broad criticism from around the world, including from progressives and young Democratic voters upset with America’s support for Israel. The Israeli government said the hospital was the site of an underground command center for Hamas and has released a photo and video of an alleged “operational tunnel shaft,” which Hamas has denied as “baseless lies.” CNN cannot verify either side’s claims.           “You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military, hidden under a hospital. And that’s a fact; that’s what’s happened,” Biden said in San Francisco. The administration gave more cover to Israel by saying it had its own independent intelligence about how Hamas used the building, though Biden refused to say what it was. Three people familiar with the assessment told CNN Thursday that it was primarily signals intelligence, including intercepted conversations among the militants.           Biden’s steadfastness on behalf of Israel is consistent with decades of support as a senator, vice president and now as president, albeit tested by periodic political differences with some Israeli governments, including an estrangement with Netanyahu that endured until a few months ago.           While the US had been Israel’s strongest supporter during its latest ordeal, American interests and Biden’s political imperatives are not directly aligned with those of Israel. Last week, for instance, the White House got stark warnings from US diplomats in the Arab world that the US was “losing Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN.           Domestically, meanwhile, the reaction to the war in Gaza has served to reveal already wide ideological splits inside the Democratic Party and the coalition on which Biden is relying to try to carry him to reelection next year. Large numbers of younger voters are showing greater support for the Palestinians than has been typical in the United States, following harrowing video footage of civilian casualties caused by relentless bombing by Israel. Protests have rocked university campuses, where there’s been an outbreak of anti-Israel feeling that has sometimes crossed into blatant antisemitism. On the left, the plight of Palestinians has also become a vessel for frustration among progressive activists and an organizing point for left-wing politics.           In the most graphic sign of the dissent Wednesday, a protest demanding a ceasefire in Gaza – for which Biden has refused to call – saw clashes between demonstrators and police outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other senior Democratic leaders were inside at the time.           The unrest offered Republicans, who are constantly criticized for insufficiently condemning mob violence in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, a chance to claim that Democrats represented a lawless fringe. Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a vocal supporter of ex-President Donald Trump, wrote on X that “the Democrat Party has fostered an antisemitic, pro-terrorist faction within their own party.”           Protests also broke out on Thursday in California on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific summit being hosted by Biden, when a line of cars shut down the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco.           While some of the protests have been eye-catching, they pale so far in comparison to the size and intensity of other demonstrations in recent years, including those of the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd, the activism during the Occupy Wall Street movement or street marches against the Iraq War. The scuffles at the DNC on Wednesday evening, while serious, also followed peaceful pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Washington in recent weeks that drew tens of thousands of protesters.           Still, the political repercussions of the war in Israel, and the way they are tearing at already evident divides on the left especially, could have an outsize impact in a close election year.           The desertion of relatively small numbers of Arab American voters in Michigan, for instance, could be decisive in a close race between Biden and the possible GOP nominee, Trump. And any further dampening of voter enthusiasm among young voters who already have questions about Biden’s advanced age and are now frustrated by his position in the Middle East could hurt the president elsewhere. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny this week uncovered significant skepticism toward Biden among young voters in Georgia, where the president won the cohort by 13 points in 2020 but now essentially splits them with Trump, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll.           The White House response to a recent round of coverage of Biden’s political liabilities has been to argue that once there is a direct comparison with Trump, if he becomes the GOP nominee, regular political patterns will reassert themselves. Biden supporters also note the stronger-than-expected showing of Democratic candidates and causes in off-year elections this month, including in state legislative races in Virginia and in a key abortion rights referendum in Ohio.           But the danger for Biden may not be that younger voters switch to Trump, but that many simply don’t tune into the election at all. That carries a risk for Democrats down the ballot, too, with the party facing a challenging Senate landscape next year, especially for vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in red states.           On one hand, it’s crass to ponder political considerations while so many people are dying, captive and grief-stricken in the Middle East. Palestinians and Israelis alike have a desperate need for the violence to end.           But at the same time, the US presidency carries its own huge stakes in an election next year that will reverberate around the world. As a matter of politics, as well as humanity, Biden also needs peace to come as soon as possible.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

politics,"Takeaways from the Biden-Xi summit, where low expectations were met",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/15/politics/takeaways-biden-xi-summit/index.html,"       It happened, therefore it was a success.     President Joe Biden’s summit with China’s President Xi Jinping south of San Francisco Wednesday may have closed a trap door under the world’s most critical diplomatic relationship, which has plunged to its most acrimonious level in 50 years.           But with expectations set so deliberately low and with each side having significant incentives to declare the meeting productive, it was hardly an achievement that the mood music was upbeat after four hours of talks, punctuated by a lunch of herbed ricotta ravioli, tarragon roasted chicken and almond meringue cake.     Biden hails productive talks with Xi as agreements reached on fentanyl and military communication         Biden came away hopeful that he had eased the risks posed by US and Chinese forces operating in perilously close quarters in the Asia-Pacific, which he wants to avoid escalating into yet another politically ruinous global crisis during his reelection bid next year.           Xi needed to make a statement to his domestic constituency in the communist hierarchy that he has vital US relations under control at a time of economic strife. He also needed to send a signal that China now sees it in its interest to deescalate tensions with other major powers, especially the US, after a fraught chapter.           Yet the important but incremental progress made at the Georgian revival-style mansion will do little to mitigate the underlying factors driving the US and China toward a more dangerous rivalry.           Styling his approach to Xi as “trust but verify,” Biden explained after the summit that while China and the US were in a competitive relationship, “my responsibility is to make it … rational and manageable, so it so it doesn’t result in conflict – that’s what I’m all about.”           Xi, while arguing that the world was big enough for both the US and China to coexist, warned that the United States should not scheme to “suppress or contain” his country, expressing Beijing’s belief that the US desire to compete with its rising rival is really aimed at thwarting China’s rightful destiny.           That’s a disconnect that a single summit had no hope of redressing.           An agreement to re-establish contacts between the US and Chinese militaries may be the most important thing Biden does this year.           “Vital miscalculations on either side can cause real, real trouble with a country like China or any other major country,” Biden told reporters.           The potential for US and Chinese naval or air forces to stumble into an incident over or on the South or East China seas is one of the nightmare national security scenarios that keeps officials and foreign policy analysts awake at night. The United States has, therefore, been trying for months to restore communication severed by China after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last year.           The Biden administration is worried about scores of what it calls “unprofessional” operations by Chinese planes and ships near US assets. For instance, a Chinese fighter came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber last month. A downing of a US plane or a collision between ships could set off a dangerous escalation that would be difficult to defuse, not least because of fraught political reactions it would unleash in both countries. The emergency landing of a US spy plane on Hainan Island in 2001 after a collision with a Chinese fighter took days of intricate diplomacy to resolve and return the crew. China is now far more aggressive, nationalistic and powerful, and a similar incident would be even more combustible.     Biden says he still believes Xi Jinping is a dictator         Even in the darkest days of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained contacts to prevent misunderstandings spiraling into Armageddon. And even amid tensions sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top brass in the Pentagon work to deconflict their operations with Moscow in war zones like Syria. The absence of such dialogue with China has been startling.           Full details of the new military-to-military contacts were not yet available on Wednesday. But the success of such efforts will depend on whether agreements made by Xi filter down to lower levels of the People’s Liberation Army forces. And local incidents or wider crises between the US and China could easily reverse Wednesday’s limited progress – as happened after Pelosi’s Taiwan trip or during the flight of a Chinese spy balloon across the United States earlier this year.           But a lowering of the threat of misjudgments or misunderstandings alone may justify Biden’s decision to meet Xi.           Biden knew his meeting with Xi would unleash a political firestorm.           Just talking to China is enough to trigger claims that the president is appeasing an enemy. Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned as the summit ended that Biden had “yet again undermined US national security interests.” The Idaho senator added: “China is not a normal country – it is an aggressor state. Biden is caving to Xi in exchange for a series of meaningless working groups and engagement mechanisms.”           Republican presidential candidates have lacerated Biden over his handling of Beijing. They have the luxury of not being responsible for stabilizing the world’s most critical diplomatic relationship and an incentive to misrepresent the intricacies of a complex situation. China bashing has long been a feature of US presidential elections, dating back at least to Democrat Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory over Republican President George H.W. Bush. But the vitriol has been especially stark this year, with GOP candidates like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis implying that louder rhetoric on its own would force China to bow to US power.           Biden had huge political incentives to make this summit a success but also needed to show he was tough on Xi.           He cannot afford, for instance, a blow-up with China in his reelection year. Already, the US is stretched as wars rage in Ukraine and the Middle East. More turmoil would fuel GOP claims that he’s old and weak and bolster Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s accusations that the world is spiraling out of control under Biden’s watch.           It was also significant that the first thing Biden said in his news conference was about a deal with Xi to stem the export from China of precursor chemicals for fentanyl that are creating a deadly narcotics epidemic in the US. It’s one thing for China to agree to curb such activity. It’s another for it to act. But Biden will save many lives if the agreement works. And he now has the talking point for the campaign trial.           In his news conference, Biden several times stressed he had been “blunt” with Xi. That’s a function of a tense diplomatic relationship. But it’s also an insurance policy against GOP claims he’s caving to China.           While he’s the most powerful Chinese leader in decades and rules a communist autocracy that allows no dissent, Xi also faces political pressures and constraints – to an extent often not appreciated in the US.           Xi arrived in San Francisco after a period of unusual turmoil in Chinese politics, firing both his foreign and defense ministers in recent months. China’s economy, meanwhile, is facing multiple crises, including a collapsing housing market and ballooning youth unemployment.           “There (was) an incentive for this meeting to go really well. China’s economy is stagnant. … They have a lot of troubles at home,” Sue Mi Terry, a former George W. Bush and Barack Obama National Security Council official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.           Xi needs to reverse a drain in foreign investment at a time when many US executives and academics question whether fierce Sino-US tensions will threaten their personal security if they even visit the country. This helps explain a charm offensive in the official Chinese media in the hours leading up to the summit – and Xi’s meetings with US business executives in San Francisco and a dinner with American friends he made on a long-ago trip to Iowa as a junior provincial official.           Next year will not simply be a turbulent one in US-China relations because of the American presidential election. The Taiwanese election in January will also pose a severe test. Xi came to the summit seeking public reaffirmation from Biden that the US still backs the “One China” policy, which acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but stops short of recognizing Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. “I’m not going to change that, that’s not going to change,” said Biden, who has nevertheless repeatedly irked Beijing by saying he’d defend Taiwan if China attacked.           A senior US official said that Xi impressed upon Biden that China wanted peaceful reunification but laid out conditions that would call for the use of force. The official said Xi remarked: “‘Look, peace is all well and good, but at some point we need to move towards resolution more generally.’”           Expectations were low heading into the summit. And they were met.           While both sides want to avoid a disastrous confrontation, the trajectory of US-China relations appears destined to bend toward confrontation, which must be constantly managed to prevent an eruption into open conflict.           Washington believes that China is the one nation that can usurp the US as the dominant global power. Biden’s formal national security strategy, a document required by Congress, says China is “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it.”           But Chinese leaders view US actions to balance Beijing’s bid to become the leading Indo-Pacific and global nation as attempts to thwart its rightful development and destiny. A recent New York Times analysis of Xi’s speeches, for instance, showed that while he has reassured US presidents that he’s keen to find areas of cooperation and defuse geopolitical tensions, he’s spoken at home of an inevitable rivalry with a US adversary he views with fatalistic suspicion. In the simultaneous translation of his remarks Wednesday, Xi appeared to imply the strains in the relationship resulted from US attitudes, saying that while conflict and confrontation would have “unbearable consequences” for both sides, “it’s unrealistic for one side to remodel the other.” A translation of official Chinese script in state media reinforced his point, reading, “It is unrealistic to try to change each other.” One interpretation is that Xi is warning against US attempts to moderate Chinese behavior, either domestically on issues like human rights or business or geopolitically in its region and beyond.           Biden is correct. It is vital for the presidents of the world’s two greatest powers to have a way of communicating in the event that conflict beckons. Both Trump and Biden argued that they had unique understandings and connections with Xi. But does the Chinese leader feel the same way? While Washington often argues that despite irreconcilable strategic goals, the US and China can work together — on climate or global security, for instance — Beijing is less publicly effusive about the idea.           Right now, opening up slightly to the US appears to be in Xi’s interests. But the forces driving the powers toward further confrontation are broad and volatile. Meeting low bars at a moderately successful summit will not change the fundamentals of their rivalry.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

politics,"Despite the House passing a stopgap funding bill, representatives acted out a farce",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/15/politics/congress-immaturity-analysis/index.html,"       Sometimes it feels like Congress is trying to parody itself.           As lawmakers stagger toward the Thanksgiving recess after some of the ugliest and most unproductive weeks in years, the place is coming completely unglued.           Despite the House passing a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open beyond this week, representatives acted out a farce Tuesday. The joke was on Americans deprived of a serious, functioning government. And don’t forget the people of Israel and Ukraine who are waiting in vain for billions of dollars in help from the US as they wage existential fights for their futures.           The 118th Congress, which took an initial step to punt funding deadlines to the winter, looked more like a fourth grade class on a day that will further erode trust in government ahead of next year’s elections. That might be fine by some of the hard-right conservatives who abhor Washington and see chaos as a worthy goal in itself. But on the eve of President Joe Biden’s critical summit with President Xi Jinping, the political tomfoolery will only bolster perceptions among US adversaries like China that America’s global power is being undermined by polarization at home.           In one extraordinarily frivolous episode on Tuesday, Kevin McCarthy – until recently the most powerful elected Republican in the country – was accused of delivering a painful blow to Rep. Tim Burchett, one of the GOP rebels who ousted him as speaker. “It was a clean shot to the kidneys,” the Tennessean told CNN’s Manu Raju.           The former GOP leader repeatedly denied the claim, blaming a tight hallway for the collision. Then, in a flash of bravado, McCarthy added: “If I kidney punched someone, they would be on the ground.”           But it wasn’t even the most fiery showdown of the day.     GOP Rep. Tim Burchett accuses Kevin McCarthy of elbowing him in the kidneys, ex-speaker denies it         Across Capitol Hill in the world’s so-called greatest deliberative body, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin was spoiling for a prize fight. He told Sean O’Brien, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to “Stand your butt up!” and challenged him to a bout. Mullin was angry at past tweets in which O’Brien apparently called him a “clown.”           “You want to do it now?” Mullin asked.           “I’d love to do right now,” O’Brien replied from the witness table.           A flabbergasted Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders waved his arms, banged his gavel and complained that he was supposed to oversee a hearing not a cage match.           “God knows, the American people have enough contempt for Congress, let’s not make it worse,” Sanders warned, reminding Mullin he was a US senator.           The normally sleeping confines of the wonkish Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee had never seen anything like it. But Mullin, posing as a Sooner State folk hero, explained to reporters he had no choice but to answer the bell. “You don’t do that in Oklahoma. You don’t run your mouth unless you’re gonna answer the call,” said the former Mixed Martial Arts fighter.           Mullin told CNN’s Dana Bash on Wednesday that he had every intention of coming to blows with O’Brien.           “I’m not somebody that’s going to say we go around and fight all the time. I got paid to fight. But I will say that every now and then, you do and you should be taught a lesson,” he told CNN.           Back in the House, tempers were fraying.           Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz got embroiled in a bitter exchange with House Oversight Chairman James Comer over the latter’s probe into the Biden family’s business affairs. After the Florida Democrat accused the Kentucky Republican of hypocrisy, Comer hit back with a bizarre riposte that will baffle future historians leafing through the congressional record. “You look like a Smurf here,” he said. Moskowitz couldn’t let it lie, writing on X that “Gargamel was very angry today.” For the many non-afficionados of the animated series, Gargamel was an evil wizard who hunted Smurfs for fun.           GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – normally the ringmaster of the Capitol Hill circus – found herself overshadowed. Yet the Georgia Republican did get into it with fellow GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who questioned her maturity over her failed attempt to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Greene responded with a social media post suggesting her California colleague was lacking in a certain area that she implied with various emojis of balls from different sports.           The fevered scenes reveal deep dysfunction and dislocation in divided Washington, where anger and personal vitriol has consumed the political system. Donald Trump-style stunt politics has often become dominant in the Capitol. Congress is consumed by fighting within and between the parties. And the febrile mood is only likely to intensify in the coming election year. Normal standards of decorum and respect have been thrown in the trash, and nearly three years after the Capitol insurrection, trust is fractured.           Congressional leaders said the near altercations and foul tempers reflected the stress of an extraordinary session that saw the House sit for 10 weeks in a row, ignoring the fact such behavior would be a sackable offense in many workplaces.           “Everybody’s tensions are high,” McCarthy said. South Dakota Sen. John Thune – a member of GOP leadership – noted with understatement that we are living in “fairly polarized times.” He added: “There is a lot going on not only here but around the world. Emotions are running high.”           Some people might see the gravity of global crises – including heart-breaking footage from the Middle East following the horrendous Hamas terror attacks against civilians and the carnage in Gaza wrought by Israel’s response – as a reason for greater seriousness among the nation’s leaders.           Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, however, suggested that policing the Capitol was beyond even his wily capacity to enforce discipline within his conference.           “It’s very difficult to control the behavior of everybody who’s in the building. I don’t view that as my responsibility. That’s something the Capitol Police will have to deal with,” the Kentucky Republican said.           In one minor miracle, the chaotically dysfunctional House of Representatives did manage to take steps Tuesday to avert a threatened government shutdown, passing a plan to temporarily fund the federal machine. The Senate still needs to approve the measure, which would only delay the next funding deadlines until early next year.           But even the House’s vote exposed the forces that threaten to tear the chamber apart again soon, with 93 Republicans opposing the bill. Conservatives are smarting at rookie Speaker Mike Johnson’s failure to include massive spending cuts that have no chance of getting past the Democratic-run Senate or Biden’s White House and that would guarantee a shutdown that would damage the GOP and bring pain to millions of Americans.     Right-wing lawmakers give Johnson a pass on government funding plan as McCarthy allies cry ‘hypocrisy’         Their recalcitrance meant that Johnson was forced to rely on Democratic votes to get it through the House, using exactly the same maneuver that cost McCarthy his job last month.           So effectively, because the GOP majority in the House is so divided, it’s only operable if Democrats want it to be.           And only in the malfunctioning Congress would a speaker try to prevent one government shutdown by laying the possible path for two others. That’s because Johnson’s “laddered” approach funds one slice of the government until mid-January and another until early February.           In deciding not to topple Johnson for adopting the same strategy as McCarthy, the rebel bloc bolstered an impression that personal rather than ideological animus was behind their political regicide.           “I mean, hypocrisy in Washington is nothing new,” Rep. Patrick McHenry, who served as interim speaker, said. Some hardliners, however, suggested Johnson was getting a pass only because he was new in the job. And veteran GOP Rules Chairman Tom Cole indicated that trauma left by the aftermath of one speaker’s demise meant no one was ready for another round.           “I think when you touch a hot stove once, you don’t do it twice,” the Oklahoma Republican told CNN.           It may just have been a coincidence of course. But Johnson, on a day when he needed to replenish some of the political capital he earned as the most right-wing speaker in history, chose to endorse Trump for president on CNBC. “I’m all in for President Trump. I expect he’ll be our nominee, and he’s going to win it, and we have to make Joe Biden a one-term president.”           Thus, a speaker – who, as a backbencher, helped orchestrate some of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – signed up again with an ex-president whose mob invaded Congress on January 6, 2021, and who falsely claims that his looming four criminal trials are part of a plot to interfere in the 2024 election.           The most glaring example of Congress’ failure to fulfill its duty on Tuesday came at a pro-Israel demonstration on the National Mall. Johnson joined Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst on stage in a show of solidarity with the Jewish state.           With the Capitol dome — a citadel of democracy for generations — over his shoulder, Johnson stared out over the crowd and the waving blue and white Israeli flags and declared: “There are few issues in Washington that so easily bring together leaders of both parties and both chambers but the survival of the state of Israel and her people unites us together.”           Until recently, that was true. There have been few easier bills to pass than those sending aid or weapons to Israel.           But in one of his first acts, Johnson complicated Biden’s emergency $14.3 billion request for Israel by loading it up with budget cuts for the Internal Revenue Service that are unacceptable to the Senate and the White House. The message is clear: once sacrosanct measures vital to US national security are now only possible if the extreme right-wing fringe of the GOP majority can get a payoff.           Israel is not alone in being neglected.           The people of Ukraine, deep into the second year of Russia’s vicious attempted conquest, are still waiting for an even bigger aid package requested by Biden. Large numbers of House Republicans want to cut support for a democratic nation reliant on US and European assistance as their mentor, Trump, vows to end the war within hours if he’s elected president, presumably on the terms of his friend Vladimir Putin.           Johnson, who has repeatedly voted against aid for Ukraine, hasn’t ruled out a new package. But he’d almost certainly have to rely on Democrats again, further fraying his authority. On the Senate side, bipartisan negotiations are taking place on a package that would twin Ukraine aid with spending on security on the southern border to give cover to Republicans. No breakthrough is in sight as Republicans accuse Democrats of not showing seriousness in the talks.           But while exhausted and aggravated lawmakers head home for their Thanksgiving dinners, time is running out for Ukraine.           “Ukraine is going to have trouble getting bullets for their guns in a couple of weeks,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy warned on Monday.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
politics,Win McNamee/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/biden-boomer-young-voters-what-matters/index.html," A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.         It was kind of funny when whoever posts Instagram photos for Joe Biden celebrated the president’s birthday this week with an image of Biden smiling in front of a cake with a bonfire of candles – presumably 81 – on top of it. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the caption reads.    A post shared by Joe Biden (@joebiden)        That wasn’t Biden’s only stab this week at poking fun at what might be his most glaring weakness, the widely held perception in opinion polls that he’s too old for another term.           At the annual White House turkey pardon, Biden made clear he was not there at the first pardon, 76 years ago, even though he was alive at the time. But then he seemed to make a generational gaffe when he conflated Beyonce’s tour with Taylor Swift’s, and then called the latter Britney Spears.           Rather than praise the birthday joke on Instagram, most commenters have taken the opportunity to criticize his support for Israel. The content of Instagram comments is not a valid measure of any sentiment, but it is true that when people see that content in their feed, they will also see the criticism.           Who knows if the Israel-Hamas war will still be a major top-of-mind issue for American voters when they go to polls in less than a year.           Who knows what will happen with the economy, one of the many areas along with his handling of Israel where polls suggest Biden has weak support, even among Democrats.           Policy tweaks and the natural course of events could change the framework of those storylines.           One thing that won’t change is that Biden will still be the oldest-ever president. While he has poked fun at himself before, the series of jokes on his birthday could be an acknowledgement that his age is an issue to defuse.           When Democrats win elections, it is frequently because of turnout by younger voters. In 2022, when Democrats held onto the Senate and only narrowly lost the House, CNN’s Harry Enten wrote they “would have gotten crushed” without younger voters.           So it is with alarm that Democrats must be looking at an NBC News poll out this week that confirms a dramatic drop in Biden’s support among young voters.           Biden is actually narrowly trailing former President Donald Trump among voters ages 18-34 in that NBC poll. Biden won voters ages 18-29 with 60% of the vote in 2020, according to exit polls. A CNN poll released in early November found a similar drop.           It’s important to remember that these current polls are among a pool of all registered voters, which is larger than the subset of people who will actually show up to vote.           It is Biden’s strong support for Israel that seems to be contributing to a generational wedge between Democrats.           In that NBC poll, only about a third of registered voters approved of his handling of the situation in Israel and only about half of Democrats approved. A majority of Democrats in the poll said Israel had gone too far in its response to the terror attacks by Hamas.           CNN’s John King found more anecdotal evidence in a new report from college campuses in Michigan, which has a large Muslim population. He talked to multiple students who said they supported or volunteered for Biden in 2020 but won’t be doing so this year.           Rather than support Trump, who has talked about reviving his ban on people from mostly Muslim countries traveling to the US, students told King they may not vote at all or may opt for a more liberal third-party candidate.           The writer Franklin Foer wrote a book about Biden, “The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden’s White House and the Struggle for America’s Future.” Appearing on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Tuesday, he said perceptions of Israel have changed around Biden.           “I think part of the generational divide is when Biden was a younger person, Zionism and liberalism were much more deeply interconnected and there was a sense that Israel was an underdog nation,” Foer said. The nation of Israel was founded in 1948.           Flip the age issue around and look at Biden’s current difficulty connecting with younger voters not as that of an octogenarian but as someone whose birthday in 1942 predates the post-World War II baby boom, which lasted from 1946 to 1964.           There was a string of four boomer presidents, three of whom (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Trump) were all born in 1946, technically the first year of the boom. The fourth, Barack Obama, is technically a boomer as he was born in 1961. There is some gray area between generations, and Obama has written of not really identifying as a baby boomer.           And then, the country went back in time from a president born in 1946 to one born in 1942 when it traded in Trump for Biden.           Incremental changes to the electorate may have important impacts in the coming years, particularly as baby boomers and voters Biden’s age represent an ever-smaller portion of the people voting. CNN’s Ronald Brownstein has written repeatedly about the changing demographics of the country and how that is affecting its politics.           “We are right now at the teetering edge of the influence of the baby boomers,” the University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald told Brownstein back in May for one such story. “They are just starting to enter those twilight years in their turnout rates, while other [more diverse] groups are maturing. So we are right at that cusp – that critical point of where things are going to start changing.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

politics,"Biden, a pre-boomer, is losing the young voters Democrats need",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/politics/biden-boomer-young-voters-what-matters/index.html," A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.         It was kind of funny when whoever posts Instagram photos for Joe Biden celebrated the president’s birthday this week with an image of Biden smiling in front of a cake with a bonfire of candles – presumably 81 – on top of it. “Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles!” the caption reads.    A post shared by Joe Biden (@joebiden)        That wasn’t Biden’s only stab this week at poking fun at what might be his most glaring weakness, the widely held perception in opinion polls that he’s too old for another term.           At the annual White House turkey pardon, Biden made clear he was not there at the first pardon, 76 years ago, even though he was alive at the time. But then he seemed to make a generational gaffe when he conflated Beyonce’s tour with Taylor Swift’s, and then called the latter Britney Spears.           Rather than praise the birthday joke on Instagram, most commenters have taken the opportunity to criticize his support for Israel. The content of Instagram comments is not a valid measure of any sentiment, but it is true that when people see that content in their feed, they will also see the criticism.           Who knows if the Israel-Hamas war will still be a major top-of-mind issue for American voters when they go to polls in less than a year.           Who knows what will happen with the economy, one of the many areas along with his handling of Israel where polls suggest Biden has weak support, even among Democrats.           Policy tweaks and the natural course of events could change the framework of those storylines.           One thing that won’t change is that Biden will still be the oldest-ever president. While he has poked fun at himself before, the series of jokes on his birthday could be an acknowledgement that his age is an issue to defuse.           When Democrats win elections, it is frequently because of turnout by younger voters. In 2022, when Democrats held onto the Senate and only narrowly lost the House, CNN’s Harry Enten wrote they “would have gotten crushed” without younger voters.           So it is with alarm that Democrats must be looking at an NBC News poll out this week that confirms a dramatic drop in Biden’s support among young voters.           Biden is actually narrowly trailing former President Donald Trump among voters ages 18-34 in that NBC poll. Biden won voters ages 18-29 with 60% of the vote in 2020, according to exit polls. A CNN poll released in early November found a similar drop.           It’s important to remember that these current polls are among a pool of all registered voters, which is larger than the subset of people who will actually show up to vote.           It is Biden’s strong support for Israel that seems to be contributing to a generational wedge between Democrats.           In that NBC poll, only about a third of registered voters approved of his handling of the situation in Israel and only about half of Democrats approved. A majority of Democrats in the poll said Israel had gone too far in its response to the terror attacks by Hamas.           CNN’s John King found more anecdotal evidence in a new report from college campuses in Michigan, which has a large Muslim population. He talked to multiple students who said they supported or volunteered for Biden in 2020 but won’t be doing so this year.           Rather than support Trump, who has talked about reviving his ban on people from mostly Muslim countries traveling to the US, students told King they may not vote at all or may opt for a more liberal third-party candidate.           The writer Franklin Foer wrote a book about Biden, “The Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden’s White House and the Struggle for America’s Future.” Appearing on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Tuesday, he said perceptions of Israel have changed around Biden.           “I think part of the generational divide is when Biden was a younger person, Zionism and liberalism were much more deeply interconnected and there was a sense that Israel was an underdog nation,” Foer said. The nation of Israel was founded in 1948.           Flip the age issue around and look at Biden’s current difficulty connecting with younger voters not as that of an octogenarian but as someone whose birthday in 1942 predates the post-World War II baby boom, which lasted from 1946 to 1964.

politics,Megan Jelinger/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/fault-lines-suburbs-elections-2023/index.html,"       The biggest question in Tuesday’s elections may be whether Democrats can maintain their advantages in the nation’s biggest population centers – despite all the headwinds buffeting the party.           Geographic polarization has been one of the most powerful trends in American politics for roughly the past two decades, with Democrats gaining ground in the most populous metropolitan areas almost everywhere, and Republicans growing stronger in the smaller places beyond them. That trend notably accelerated after Donald Trump emerged as the GOP’s dominant figure in 2016 and has ratcheted up since the Supreme Court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion last year.           The GOP’s dominance of exurban, small-town and rural areas helped Trump win the White House in 2016 and has allowed the party to solidify its grip up and down the ballot on interior states with large nonurban populations. But Republicans’ retreat from the well-educated inner suburbs around major cities has been the principal reason for their disappointing results in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections, as well as the anti-abortion movement’s defeat in a series of ballot initiatives since the 2022 Supreme Court decision.     Visit CNN’s Election Center to follow key races         By traditional measures, the political environment for Tuesday’s election again looks favorable for Republicans, with most voters expressing dissatisfaction about both the economy and President Joe Biden’s job performance. But all of those conditions were present in the 2022 midterms, when Republicans underperformed anyway, mostly because of continued resistance in the major population centers – especially those well-educated inner suburbs where most voters oppose new restrictions on abortion.           The largest urban and suburban areas will likely determine whether Democrats can defy political gravity once again this year in Tuesday’s key elections, from Kentucky and Ohio to Virginia and Pennsylvania. If Democrats run well, it will reinforce the message from the 2022 midterms that they can hold a critical swathe of voters who feel the party has not delivered for their interests by portraying Republicans as a threat to their rights and values.           That dynamic may be most clearly on display in the expensive, high-stakes struggle for control of the Virginia legislature. Heading into Tuesday’s vote, Democrats hold a narrow majority in the state Senate and Republicans hold a slim edge in the state House of Delegates.           As in many competitive states during the 2022 election, Republicans, by most conventional political measures, are well positioned in Virginia. Even though Biden carried the commonwealth by 10 percentage points in 2020, polling now shows more voters disapprove than approve of his performance; conversely, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has made himself the face of the GOP’s legislative campaign, consistently draws majority approval from state voters. To support the GOP ticket, Youngkin has also raised huge sums of money – much of it from national Republican donors hoping that a strong result Tuesday might entice him into a late entry into the GOP presidential race. And in a recent statewide poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, Virginia voters gave Republicans a double-digit advantage over Democrats when asked which party they trusted to handle both the economy and crime, two issues central to families’ day-to-day concerns.           “In normal circumstances, with an incumbent Democrat [president] under water, as Biden is, and the economy playing so strongly in favor of Republicans, you would expect a Democratic wipe-out,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School. “But that’s just not happening.”           Instead, the Post/Schar survey showed Democrats slightly leading when voters were asked which party they intended to support in the Virginia legislative contests.           Translating that broad sentiment into individual state House and Senate race results is an imperfect process. And because the margins in each chamber are so narrow, most analysts agree that both chambers are still within reach of either party.           But generally, observers following the contests say they will be surprised if Republicans win control of both chambers – and maybe less startled if Democrats flip the state House while holding the Senate to achieve control of their own. “It doesn’t really feel like 2021,” when Youngkin stunned Democrats by surging in the final weeks to capture the governorship, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the political newsletter published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “At the very least a Republican sweep would be a surprise. And a Democratic sweep would be less surprising.”   These candidates in Virginia could shape how both parties talk about abortion in 2024         Both parties agree the Democratic emphasis on protecting legal abortion is the principal reason the party remains in such a competitive position, despite all the other GOP advantages. In the Post/Schar poll, Democrats led Republicans by nearly 20 points when Virginia voters were asked which party they trusted to handle abortion; the share of female voters who said abortion was an important issue in their choice stood at 70%, way up from just under half in polling around the 2019 legislative elections. Warnings that Republicans will restrict abortion rights dominate Democratic advertising in most of the key races.  “If we win, we win because of it,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster working on the Virginia races, said of abortion. “And if we turn out our base, we turn out our base because of it.”           The Democratic emphasis on preserving abortion rights isn’t unusual: The party did the same in virtually every competitive race in 2022. More unusual is how much Virginia Republicans have emphasized the issue too. Youngkin has made clear that if provided control of the legislature, Republicans will ban abortion at 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. The governor’s political advisers argue that voters will see such restrictions as a “consensus” solution to a polarizing issue, and the latest Post/Schar poll, like earlier surveys, found the state split about evenly over a 15-week ban. “I really feel that this is a moment for us to come together around reasonable limits,” Youngkin argued on ABC News this past weekend. “I think that this is a reasonable place for us to land.”           But Democrats believe the more telling measure is that only about one-fourth of Virginia voters say in polls they want the state’s abortion laws made more restrictive than the current standard, which permits the procedure through 26 weeks of pregnancy. By emphasizing their plan to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks, Rozell and others believe, Republicans have raised the salience of the issue that most favors Democrats. Heather Williams, the interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, briskly encapsulated the Democrats’ closing message when she said: “When voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they know that if they wake up on Wednesday and there is Republican control in the state, there will be an abortion ban. Period.”           Control of both chambers will be decided primarily in relatively well-educated suburban House and Senate districts across the state, particularly in Northern and Central Virginia, around Washington, DC, and Richmond. The Post/Schar poll gave Democrats a roughly 25-point advantage in the former and a 10-point lead in the latter. If the state’s major suburban areas break for Democrats because of abortion, “that is basically the ballgame,” said Kondik.           If populous (and mostly prosperous) suburbs prove the bridge too far for Virginia Republicans, it would extend a striking pattern from other recent contests in which abortion has played a central role. In the seven states that have held ballot initiatives related to the issue since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision, the side favoring abortion rights has consistently dominated the largest places.           In these ballot initiatives, abortion rights supporters carried all six of the counties that cast the most votes in Kansas, eight of the 10 counties that cast the most votes in Kentucky and Michigan, and the 14 largest in California. Even in Montana, which doesn’t have many population centers, an anti-abortion ballot measure lost in all three of the counties that cast the most votes. (A Vermont constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in 2022 carried every town in the state.) In this summer’s first round of Ohio’s battle over abortion – a GOP-backed measure to make it more difficult to change the state’s Constitution – the abortion rights side carried 14 of the state’s 17 largest counties, including several that had voted for Trump in 2020, according to the results posted by The New York Times.     Abortion rights groups have been on a winning streak. Opponents hope Ohio’s Issue 1 offers a reset   Round two of Ohio’s confrontation over abortion will come Tuesday when voters will decide a ballot measure that would repeal a six-week ban on the procedure that the GOP legislature passed, and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed, in 2019. Some voters have been confused because both this summer’s proposed change to the state constitution and the current measure to repeal the abortion ban have been designated as Issue One, and the position in support of abortion rights was a “no” vote over the summer and is a “yes” vote now. But the limited polling available has found the measure likely to pass, largely because of preponderant support among urban and suburban voters.           Democrats are counting on similar metro support in two other races Tuesday in which abortion has loomed large: a state Supreme Court contest in Pennsylvania and Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s reelection bid against Republican state Attorney General Daniel Cameron. When Beshear narrowly won a first term in the Republican-leaning state four years ago, he combined a strong performance in the state’s major population centers of Louisville and Lexington with an unusually competitive showing in smaller, blue-collar Eastern Kentucky counties. But Beshear will likely struggle to match his small town performance this year with hostility to Biden running high in those places.  Beshear this time is stressing his support for abortion rights, and if he wins, he will likely have relied even more on Kentucky’s largest counties, including several that are functionally suburbs of Cincinnati, just across the Ohio border.           The Pennsylvania Supreme Court election between Republican Carolyn Carluccio and Democrat Daniel McCaffery will likely follow a similar path. As Kondik and a colleague noted in a recent analysis, the most recent state Supreme Court election (in 2021) did not track Pennsylvania’s usual presidential patterns, which have seen Democrats gaining in major white-collar suburban areas around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Republicans advancing in the mostly blue-collar, smaller places between them. But with abortion and voting rights dominating the current race, Kondik said it is much more likely to follow the presidential map, which should provide Democrats the edge.           In all these ways, Tuesday’s elections may underscore the intractability of the geographic polarization that has reshaped American politics through the 21st century. In 2020, Biden won fully 91 of the nation’s 100 largest counties, while Trump carried over 2,500 of the remaining 3,000. Biden dominated all the hubs of the emerging information economy: According to tabulations by Brookings Metro, a nonpartisan think tank, Biden-won counties generated 71% of the nation’s total economic output, even though he captured  only one-sixth of counties overall. Trump romped in the nonmetro places that are home to much of the nation’s manufacturing, energy extraction and agriculture.     The 2022 election showed how difficult it was to dislodge these patterns. Despite the widespread discontent over Biden and the economy, Democrats in the key races maintained (or even enlarged) advantages in populous suburban counties outside Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin. Republicans continued to post strong numbers beyond those metro areas – and in some cases, Democrats suffered diminished margins in heavily minority inner-city neighborhoods where discontent over the economy is widespread. But the Democratic suburban gains allowed them to win seven of the nine governor’s and Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the five states that decided the 2020 presidential race by switching from Trump in 2016 to Biden.           Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University, said voters’ geographic separation into blue metros and red non-metros has enormous, possibly irreversible, momentum. That separation now reflects not only political choices, he noted, but also decisions by marketers, who reinforce the diverging demographic patterns by locating retail outlets and restaurants that appeal to the predominant groups in each region. Everyone now understands the underlying cultural differences between a community with a Whole Foods or a Panera Bread, and one with a Cracker Barrel. “A community develops in a certain way and attracts a certain kind of person with certain beliefs and the consumer marketing industry reads that pretty quickly and knows the things to put in those locations to appeal to those people,” Chinni said. “It seems to me everything that’s built into the system is designed to reinforce these differences.”           Both parties are uneasy about where this geographic resorting has left them. Many Democrats worry that their rural decline dangerously constricts the number of House and Senate seats they can realistically win. Many Republicans in turn worry that it’s a losing hand to trade gains in rural places that are stagnant or declining in population for losses in suburban areas that are growing. “It’s a trajectory that is not sustainable for Republicans,” said veteran Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul. Referring to the major suburban county outside Milwaukee and a rural Western Wisconsin county, he added, “We can’t subtract three voters in Waukesha County for a voter in Trempealeau County. The math doesn’t work.”           The persistent public dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance on the economy, crime and other issues provides Republicans a powerful wedge to move voters in the major population centers away from Democrats. Tuesday’s major elections will test whether that discontent is sufficient to overcome the durable doubts in these places about the Trump-era GOP on issues relating to rights, personal freedoms and democracy. The results will offer the year’s last major ballot-box test of how voters are balancing those contrasting beliefs almost exactly one year before they pick the next president.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

Even in Montana, which doesn’t have many population centers, an anti-abortion ballot measure lost in all three of the counties that cast the most votes. (A Vermont constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in 2022 carried every town in the state.) In this summer’s first round of Ohio’s battle over abortion – a GOP-backed measure to make it more difficult to change the state’s Constitution – the abortion rights side carried 14 of the state’s 17 largest counties, including several that had voted for Trump in 2020, according to the results posted by The New York Times.

When Beshear narrowly won a first term in the Republican-leaning state four years ago, he combined a strong performance in the state’s major population centers of Louisville and Lexington with an unusually competitive showing in smaller, blue-collar Eastern Kentucky counties. But Beshear will likely struggle to match his small town performance this year with hostility to Biden running high in those places.  Beshear this time is stressing his support for abortion rights, and if he wins, he will likely have relied even more on Kentucky’s largest counties, including several that are functionally suburbs of Cincinnati, just across the Ohio border.

Despite the widespread discontent over Biden and the economy, Democrats in the key races maintained (or even enlarged) advantages in populous suburban counties outside Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin. Republicans continued to post strong numbers beyond those metro areas – and in some cases, Democrats suffered diminished margins in heavily minority inner-city neighborhoods where discontent over the economy is widespread. But the Democratic suburban gains allowed them to win seven of the nine governor’s and Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the five states that decided the 2020 presidential race by switching from Trump in 2016 to Biden.           Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University, said voters’ geographic separation into blue metros and red non-metros has enormous, possibly irreversible, momentum. That separation now reflects not only political choices, he noted, but also decisions by marketers, who reinforce the diverging demographic patterns by locating retail outlets and restaurants that appeal to the predominant groups in each region. Everyone now understands the underlying cultural differences between a community with a Whole Foods or a Panera Bread, and one with a Cracker Barrel. “A community develops in a certain way and attracts a certain kind of person with certain beliefs and the consumer marketing industry reads that pretty quickly and knows the things to put in those locations to appeal to those people,” Chinni said. “It seems to me everything that’s built into the system is designed to reinforce these differences.”           Both parties are uneasy about where this geographic resorting has left them. Many Democrats worry that their rural decline dangerously constricts the number of House and Senate seats they can realistically win. Many Republicans in turn worry that it’s a losing hand to trade gains in rural places that are stagnant or declining in population for losses in suburban areas that are growing. “It’s a trajectory that is not sustainable for Republicans,” said veteran Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul. Referring to the major suburban county outside Milwaukee and a rural Western Wisconsin county, he added, “We can’t subtract three voters in Waukesha County for a voter in Trempealeau County. The math doesn’t work.”           The persistent public dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance on the economy, crime and other issues provides Republicans a powerful wedge to move voters in the major population centers away from Democrats. Tuesday’s major elections will test whether that discontent is sufficient to overcome the durable doubts in these places about the Trump-era GOP on issues relating to rights, personal freedoms and democracy. The results will offer the year’s last major ballot-box test of how voters are balancing those contrasting beliefs almost exactly one year before they pick the next president.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

business,Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/tech/elon-musk-texas-lawsuit-media-matters/index.html,"       Some legal experts are panning Elon Musk’s lawsuit targeting the watchdog group Media Matters, saying the complaint filed Monday by X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, runs contrary to the First Amendment and could backfire wildly — if it progresses at all.           The lawsuit filed Monday accuses Media Matters of publishing a report that distorted the likelihood of ads appearing beside extremist content on X, a move the social media company says led major and influential advertisers to suspend their campaigns en masse. The company alleges that the group’s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and calls for a judge to force Media Matters to take down the analysis.           The case appears to be a “bogus” attempt to chill criticism in a way that “flatly contradicts basic First Amendment principles,” Ted Boutrous, a First Amendment attorney with years of experience dealing with the tech industry, told CNN. Boutrous added that the case could backfire for X in the discovery phase, as Media Matters could demand internal information that, if presented at trial, could prove embarrassing or highly damaging to the social media company.           The lawsuit also contains “fatal flaws” by conceding that ads did, in fact, appear beside extremist content, regardless of how Media Matters achieved that result, according to Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN contributor.           “The complaint admits that the thing Media Matters was making a big deal about actually happened,” Vladeck said. “Most companies wouldn’t want their ads running next to neo-Nazi content even once, and wouldn’t care about the exact percentage of users who were encountering such side-by-side placement.”           Contrary to the complaint, Media Matters “never claimed that what it found was typical of other users’ experience,” Vladeck added.           But even as some analysts mock the lawsuit as weak on the merits, they aren’t ruling out that it could move forward, thanks to X’s apparently deliberate decision to file in a Texas court seen as generally favorable to his cause.           On Monday, X’s case was assigned to District Judge Mark Pittman, a Donald Trump appointee who was previously at the center of some of the nation’s biggest legal battles, including over gun rights and President Joe Biden’s blocked student loan forgiveness plan.           The big question, legal experts say, is whether Musk’s choice of venue — the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas — can help him overcome some of the lawsuit’s substantive shortcomings.           In accusing Media Matters of distorting the truth, X has alleged that the group misrepresented how likely it is for advertisers’ ads to show up against pro-Nazi or White supremacist content. According to Musk, Media Matters established a test account following extremist material and then refreshed the feed until X’s ad system displayed an ad for major brands.           X does not appear to dispute the fact that X has monetized extremist content or that the brands’ ads ran beside it.           “X does admit the ads were shown next to hateful content, but argues it was ‘rare,’” said Joan Donovan, a professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University. “This is the same strategy employed by advertisers that got YouTube to demonetize political content in 2017.”           Akiva Cohen, a litigation attorney at Kamerman, Uncyk, Soniker & Klein in New York, pointed out that while Musk has historically relied on massive, white-shoe law firms in his other cases — such as his lawsuit with Twitter over the original acquisition and against former Twitter employees — in this situation, he is relying on a much smaller firm.           “All those big firms Elon usually uses? They probably went ‘f***, no, are you out of your mind? This is a baaaaad idea,’” Cohen said in a post on the X alternative BlueSky.           “He went with politically connected Texas lawyers, reflecting the extent to which people think that Texas courts are political actors, not legal actors,” Cohen added. “All three of the lawyers in that signature block have backgrounds with the Texas AG’s office or Solicitor General’s office.”           As it happens, immediately following Musk’s lawsuit on Monday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a fraud investigation into Media Matters. And Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey posted on X that his office was doing the same, news to which Musk responded: “Great!”           Musk’s court pick reveals an attempt to “shore up a weak claim on the merits with a bench more likely to be sympathetic even to weak claims,” said Vladeck. “It’s one of those lawsuits that’s filed more for symbolism than for substance.”           In a statement Monday evening, Media Matters President Angelo Carusone vowed to defend the group against the suit.           “This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X’s critics into silence,” Carusone said. “Media Matters stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.”           Some legal experts suggested that Media Matters’ first course of action may be to try to move the case out of the Texas federal court. X is headquartered in California, while Media Matters is based in Washington, D.C. The Texas court reflects an “absence of any logical connection to the dispute,” Vladeck said.           If the case isn’t transferred out of Texas, the apparent deliberate choice of court could work in X’s favor by preventing Media Matters from leveraging state laws in California and the District of Columbia that are designed to limit litigation intended to suppress criticism. These so-called “anti-SLAPP” laws do not apply in the federal appeals court that oversees Texas, said Ken White, a First Amendment lawyer based in Los Angeles.           “X filed this in federal court in Texas to avoid application of an anti-SLAPP statute,” White said on BlueSky, adding: “X’s purpose is to harass and abuse and maximize the cost of litigation, and anti-SLAPP statutes interfere with that aim.”           Even if Musk can somehow convince a court to look skeptically at Media Matters’ methodology, it does not prove that Media Matters’ report was directly responsible for the advertiser revolt, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the civil rights group Free Press. So far, none of the brands that have suspended advertising on X have directly cited the Media Matters analysis as the reason for their decision.           “Musk and his lawyers seek to isolate Media Matters’ investigation as the sole reason major advertisers have joined the exodus from X. But these major brands are not naive,” Benavidez told CNN. “They have not only seen their ads placed next to repulsive content, but also witnessed Musk’s own abhorrent online behavior, including amplifying antisemitic posts by other bigots and bullies on the platform.”           Brands “have every right to exercise their own free speech rights when deciding how to spend their ad dollars,” she added.     – CNN’s Oliver Darcy and Jon Passantino contributed to this report  © 2023 Cable News Network.

business,Unions are the strongest in decades. Nearly a million Americans got double-digit raises as a result,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/big-paydays-union-members/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Nearly 900,000 Americans sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner this week will have unions – and the double-digit pay increases they won – to thank.           That’s how many unionized workers have won immediate pay hikes of 10% or more in just the last year, according to an analysis by CNN.           And the pace of increases of that size have been picking up. More than 700,000 of those workers won pay hikes over the course of the last six months, and of that group, nearly 300,000 saw deals reached in just the last six weeks.           “I would say this is the best run of wage increases won by labor since the period right after the end of World War II,” said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations in Buffalo.           Some of the deals arrived at the end of high-profile strikes, such as the United Auto Workers union strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which lasted more than six weeks, or one by 75,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente, who waged the largest US health care strike ever over just three days in October.           Strikes this summer by the 11,000 members of the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors, shut down most film and television production by the major studios and streaming services. The unions won significant pay increases and job protections they were seeking. But because they didn’t have across-the-board increases in pay of more than 10%, those union’s 171,000 members are not included in those count of workers receiving double-digit pay raises.           Other deals happened because of the threat of a strike without the workers having to hit the picket lines. They include a deal covering 340,000 members of the Teamsters union at UPS or a series of deals reached by the Culinary union that prevented strikes at 18 different casinos along the Las Vegas Strip.           But some other new contracts reached got relatively little attention, such as 32,000 workers at DisneyWorld and 30,000 non-teaching employees of Los Angeles schools.           Many of the other lower-profile deals came in the airline industry, which operates under a different labor law than the one that controls most US labor relations, and greatly limits their ability to go on strike.           Without a strike threat, the negotiations got comparatively little public attention. But thanks to highly skilled work, wage gains at airlines have been substantial. Pilots at American and United airlines each won immediate pay increases of more than 20%, and more than 40% over the life of their contracts. Flight attendants at Southwest also won immediate wage increases of more than 20%.           And more wage gains in the airline industry are in the works. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants union that represents more than 23,000 members at American Airlines are summarily rejecting an immediate 11% pay increase offer, and demanding a 35% pay hike. Pilots at FedEx in July rejected a deal that would have raised wages 30% over four-and-a-half years. The parties just recently resumed negotiations.           And it’s not just airline workers who are sensing their increased leverage, rejecting negotiated deals and demanding more.           While 2,100 workers at two Detroit casinos returned to work this week after a month on strike, rank-and-file members ratified a contract that grants them an 18% pay hike in the first year of the contract. About 1,600 workers at a third casino in the city, one owned by MGM Entertainment, voted against a similar contract and will remain on strike.           And even with some of the contracts that pass, some union members offer significant opposition, believing they could have negotiated for even more.           The UAW contracts will give 145,000 members at traditional Big Three automakers immediate 11% pay hikes, 14 percentage points of additional pay increases over the life of the contract and a return of cost-of-living adjustments to protect workers from price increases in the broader economy. But nearly one-third of members at Ford and Stellantis voted against the deals, as did 45% of workers at GM, where workers at more than a dozen plant voted against the contract.           Labor experts say some of the success at the bargaining table traces to a more ambitious set of bargaining goals by unions, sometime led by recently elected leaders who ran on the promise of better contracts.         “There’s growing frustration with the status of working people, a growing belief among workers that the growing inequality and excessive profits is a significant problem,” said Columbia Law School Professor Kate Andrias, an expert on labor and employment law. “The leadership of some of these unions won elections by pledging to take action to address that.”           That new activist leadership was in charge of negotiations at both the UAW and the Teamsters. And the UAW’s unique strike strategy also proved very effective.           Rather than targeting only one automaker in negotiations and possibly striking that target, it waged the first simultaneous strike against all three unionized automakers. But it didn’t shut down the entire industry, instead starting with a strike at one assembly factory at each automaker, and then expanding the scope of the strike six times in a successful effort to turn up pressure at the bargaining table.           But just as important as the unions’ leadership and bargaining strategy was the economic environment in which the talks were held.     Unemployment has been below 4% since early 2022, the longest period it has remained below that level since 1969. There are far more job openings than unemployed job seekers, the opposite of conditions in the US labor market most years.           That has left employers scrambling for help and less eager to see workers walk off the job thanks to paltry pay and poor working conditions.           And many of the employers agreeing to these deals had been reporting strong profits of their own.           UPS reported record profits in 2023, as did General Motors and Stellantis, while Ford reported near record profits. After suffering through a loss of business during the pandemic, seats on airplanes and hotel rooms at Vegas casino are full, and airfares and room rates are higher than they were before the pandemic.           One of the UAW’s slogans during the auto strike was “Record profits, record contracts.” That proved to be the case in numerous labor talks.           It’s always better for a union to be negotiating with a financially healthy employer rather than a struggling one, said Greg Regan, president of the transportation trades department of the AFL-CIO.           “The economy is very strong right now. There’s a huge amount of profits. It’s true with auto industry, true with airlines, true with railroads,”  Regan said. “A lot of times the profits soared because of reduced headcounts. In many ways this is a way to reset the labor market.”           And these contracts are also a sign that employers could have been paying workers more all along, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist and president of the Economic Policy Institute, a union-supported think tank.     Here’s why the Big Three won’t need to raise car prices to pay for these labor deals         “What we’ve seen until the recent period is a real imbalance of power has allowed employers to set wages at a level below what their revenue and profits could bear,” she said. “We’re seeing some reversal of that right now.”           These labor deals will therefore likely eat into corporate profits somewhat, but they’ll have limited impact on prices that businesses can charge, since pricing is more dependent upon the supply and demand for product than strictly on the cost to produce it.           Union workers aren’t the only ones seeing increases in wages due to the tight labor market. Labor Department data shows that average hourly wage in October was up 4.3% over a year ago, and up 18% compared to three years ago, nearly the best 3-year gain in 40 years.           But not surprisingly, the union members are enjoying better gains. Union members earned average weekly pay of $1,216 last year, or 18% more than the average pay of $1,029 for nonunion workers, according to Labor Department data.           Some nonunion employers, notably foreign automakers Toyota, Honda and Hyundai that operate US factories, are raising their wages in the wake of the UAW deals. There are likely concerns at those companies about the union’s stated goal of organizing workers there.           But despite the UAW’s ambitious organizing goals, US labor law is still stacked against union efforts to win the right to represent additional work places. And that is true even in cases where unions find widespread success, such as the union organizing drive at Starbucks.           The union there, Starbucks Workers United, has won votes at more than 360 locations since its first victory in December of 2021, or more than one every other day. But no contract has been reached for the more than 9,000 Starbucks workers who are now union members. The union just staged its largest strike at Starbucks for one day last week, but there’s no sign it is any closer to reaching deals for its members. The company and union blame each other for the lack of progress.           “They may not get one until they change the labor law,” said Cornell’s Wheaton. “There’s nothing in the labor law that say Starbucks has to say yes to a contract.”           One other factor behind many of these union negotiating victories is that they come in industries already heavy unionized. Overall only 7.2 million, or 6%, of private sector workers are union members. That’s down from nearly 12 million, or 17% in 1983 when the Labor Department started tracking union membership.           But about 46% of US auto production is still at unionized plants and most of the nation’s major airline pilots, mechanics and flight attendants are union members, as are workers in film and television industries.           So winning contracts in business segments with limited union representation is much more difficult.           Still, despite the fact that not all unions are able to share in the success so far, the high profile wins are an important lift for the US union movement, which has been losing membership, and bargaining leverage, for decades. And it can lead to more success down the road.           “I think there is a momentum aspect of this,” said EPI’s Shierholz. “The success, and the public support for these strikers, that stiffens the spine of those striking or threatening to strike. It feels like a lesson being re-learned about the power in collective action.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,IRS postpones rule change on digital payment reporting for small businesses and side hustles,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/success/irs-postpones-1099-k-rule-change/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            For the second year in a row, the IRS has decided to postpone implementation of a rule change that would affect tax filers who receive business income for their goods and services via payment apps and online marketplaces like Venmo, CashApp, Etsy and Airbnb, among others.           The change might have resulted in 44 million more 1099-K forms being sent in January to such filers, including small business owners, freelancers, those with side hustles and gig workers.           In explaining why it is postponing implementation again, the IRS cited concern over potential taxpayer confusion and the need to make it easier for all parties to comply with the change.           “We spent many months gathering feedback from third-party groups and others, and it became increasingly clear we need additional time to effectively implement the new reporting requirements,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “We want to make this as easy as possible for taxpayers. We will work to make the new reporting requirements easier for them, and we’ll work closely with third-party groups, tax professionals and others to find the smoothest path to ensure compliance with the law.”     IRS announces new income tax brackets         For this tax year, the reporting rule that has been in effect for years still applies.           Third-party payment platforms – also known as third-party settlement organizations – must report your gross business income to you and the IRS in January only if you conducted more than 200 business transactions on that platform and earned more than a total of $20,000 from them.           A business transaction is defined as a payment for a good or service, including tips. It does not include personal transactions, like your friend paying you for their share of dinner. Or for money you send your child to pay for expenses.           (Should you end up getting a 1099-K in error, either because your business transactions didn’t exceed this year’s thresholds or because the form reflects money transactions that were personal, check this IRS page for how to correct the situation).          The rule change, which was enacted under the American Rescue Plan of 2021, will eventually require that third-party platforms issue you a 1099-K if you made more than $600 in annual business income over one or more business transactions.           But the IRS on Tuesday said for tax year 2024, rather than implement the $600 threshold it will instead “phase-in” the change, and only require third-party platforms to issue you a 1099-K if your business transactions exceed $5,000.           “This phased-in approach will allow the agency to review its operational processes to better address taxpayer and stakeholder concerns,” the IRS said.           The Coalition for 1099-K Tax Fairness – members of which include the Electronic Transactions Association, Airbnb, PayPal, Eventbrite, Etsy, Poshmark and others – said the delay will give members of Congress time to come up with a “permanent, bipartisan fix” to the rule. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle –- including Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana – have pushed for a higher income threshold to be used.           “The Biden Administration’s decision represents a victory for common-sense tax policy by ensuring that consumers are not facing a tsunami of 1099-Ks in January,” said Arshi Siddiqui, a partner at Akin Gump, who is leading the Coalition’s lobbying efforts.     Next year, you can put more money away for retirement and get a tax break         Neither the delay of the rule change nor the eventual implementation of it will change your tax burden in any way.           That’s because you have always been obligated as a taxpayer to report the money you make from your business activities to the IRS.           The difference once the rule change goes into effect is that the IRS will be learning about your business income from a third party payment platform. So that will make it harder for someone to evade the taxes they owe if they’re tempted to underreport what they made.           And the change will effectively pull back the curtain on just how much business income is being generated on third-party payment platforms.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Ford battery plant is back on track but scaled down,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/ford-battery-plant-downscaled/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Ford has restarted work on an electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan, but the plant will be smaller than was originally planned.           Ford paused work at the site in late September during the United Auto Workers strike, saying at the time that the company needed to reevaluate the scope of the project. The automaker had originally planned to employ as many as 2,500 workers at the factory when the plant opened for production in 2026.           Now Ford plans to employ only about 1,700 people, the automaker announced Tuesday.           “[W}e are right-sizing as we balance investment, growth, and profitability,” Ford said in an announcement.           Last month, Ford had laid off some workers building the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck. Competitor General Motors also said it was postponing adding more production capacity for its electric Chevrolet Silverado EV citing slow-growing demand.           By producing batteries in the United States, the plant should help Ford to take advantage of EV tax credits tied, in part, to domestic battery manufacturing.           Plans called for the plant to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. but build batteries using “knowledge” and services from the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL. CATL is the world’s largest battery manufacturer and also supplies batteries to Tesla.           Ford is also building two battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. The automaker is building those plants with SK Innovations, a company based in South Korea. Ford has said it plans to be able to produce two million electric vehicles globally by late 2026.

business,The fate of OpenAI hangs in the balance,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/tech/openai-sam-altman-board-microsoft/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Nearly a week into a leadership crisis that’s thrown the artificial intelligence industry into chaos, OpenAI’s future along with that of its former CEO Sam Altman remain as uncertain as ever.           If Altman’s abrupt ouster came as a surprise, it was nothing compared to the ensuing chaos and whiplash of the past few days that led the vast majority of OpenAI’s employees to threaten the company with their resignations. That has only reinforced the impression that OpenAI’s boardroom drama could take an unexpected turn at any moment.           As if to underscore the confusion, Monday began with an announcement that Altman would be joining Microsoft to lead an in-house AI research team, and the day ended with Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, saying a different outcome was still possible.           “If something happens where their board and people decide they want to get back to some kind of state,” Nadella told CNN contributor Kara Swisher on Swisher’s podcast, “one thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back to into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again. That’s done.”           “If we go back to operating like on Friday,” Nadella added, “we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”           On Tuesday, multiple news outlets, including Bloomberg and Reuters, reported that the OpenAI board and Altman are in open talks to negotiate his possible return. Such a newfound possibility highlights the volatility of a moment that carries broad ramifications for the AI industry, shaping how Microsoft may direct billions in future investments into AI.           The situation’s fluidity has been a hallmark of the crisis. First came the board’s sudden promotion of OpenAI’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, as Altman’s replacement on Friday — made in the same breath as Altman’s firing. Then, hours later, Murati herself signed a letter with hundreds of her colleagues calling for Altman’s return, for the board to resign, and threatening to quit.           A co-founder and member of the board who by some accounts led the charge on Altman’s ouster, Ilya Sutskever, inexplicably signed the letter too, and on Monday publicly apologized for his own role in the saga. For a time, it appeared perhaps as if the board members would step down, but that has not yet happened, either.           Then Microsoft, which has a deep partnership with OpenAI, announced Monday it would hire Altman to lead an advanced in-house AI research team, plucking him out of sudden unemployment. Except now, it seems, the deal is not yet final.           Whether Altman is working for Microsoft or OpenAI won’t change the ultimate result, Nadella argued to Swisher, which is that Microsoft benefits from his work. And that is true so far as it goes.           But what happens with OpenAI won’t affect just Microsoft; Altman, along with the hundreds of OpenAI staffers who have threatened to quit unless he is reinstated and the board resigns, represents a locus of power and talent in the AI industry with few equals.           Some are already seeking to capitalize on the moment: On Monday afternoon, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff encouraged OpenAI refugees to come work for his company, promising to match their compensation “immediately.” Nadella said Monday that Microsoft “will definitely have a place for all AI talent” from OpenAI that chooses to jump ship.           The competition for AI talent, and where that power represented by Altman and his allies ultimately winds up, will have an indelible influence on the course of AI development.           The outcome of the crisis could also define a turning point for a long-running ideological battle in Silicon Valley over the long-term risks of AI, which appear to have been at the center of the tensions between Altman and the board that summarily fired him.           Much is still unclear about the board’s exact reasons for firing Altman. Its official explanation was that Altman was not sufficiently “candid” with the board, and OpenAI’s chief operating officer has reportedly said the termination was not related to “malfeasance” or any financial, security or privacy issues. A key factor, Swisher has reported, seems to have been board concerns about Altman’s preferred pace or scope of AI development, highlighting fears about the dangers of an uncontrolled super-intelligence. OpenAI’s newest interim CEO, Emmett Shear, has denied that the firing was due to any “specific” disagreement on AI safety.           Throughout this game of telephone, the board itself has remained steadfastly silent, leaving outsiders to speculate about its motivations and the power play that led to Altman getting axed.           In the process, it’s created room for critics to accuse the board of incompetence and short-sightedness that risks indirectly discrediting their position on AI risk, too.           “One thing in the OpenAI stuff that feels consistent (based on some internal convos I’ve had) is that a group of people that are *laser focused on the doomer elements of AI and the more abstract principle of AGI [artificial general intelligence] for the betterment of humanity* might also be the same people who do not fully think through the more human/money elements of firing the figurehead of the generative AI movement and pissing off the company that invested $10 billion in a very specific company/vision,” wrote the journalist Charlie Warzel in a post on Threads over the weekend.           Without weighing in on the substantive fears of existential AI risk, it is possible that one casualty of the OpenAI fiasco may end up being the credibility of some of those who worry about AI the most.

business,October is prime apple season. Why did prices plunge?,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/apple-prices/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            As you make your way down the grocery aisle, maybe picking up supplies for apple pie, you might notice something interesting. The price of flour, sugar and butter? Up. But the price of apples? Way down.           From September to October, adjusting for seasonal swings, flour prices rose 0.9%, butter got 2.1% pricier and sugar prices were up 1.6%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.           But apple prices plunged 7.9%.           Consumer packaged goods companies have been raising prices, affecting what shoppers see in center aisles. But in the dairy aisle and the produce sections, prices are more closely tied to what’s happening in the natural world. Bad weather, exacerbated by climate change, can mean a bad crop, squeezing supply and driving up prices. Good weather can have the opposite effect.           This year, apples are plentiful (and delicious) thanks to great apple-growing weather — moderate temperatures with nice moist soil — in the spring. That, coupled with typical seasonal trends, lower freight costs and changing dynamics in the export market, has pulled down prices this fall.           That’s good for apple enthusiasts and pie bakers. But it’s got farmers, already facing a challenging environment because of high costs and unpredictable weather, on edge.           In general, apple prices dip in the fall, because that’s when they’re harvested and flood the market. But a supply glut this year has made the price decline even sharper.           This past spring, apple growing conditions in the United States were ideal — a welcome reversal following a few rough seasons.           Two years ago, extreme heat “baked apples on the trees,” said Chris Gerlach, director of industry analytics at the US Apple Association, which represents the apple industry in the US. And last year, a cold spring made pollinating bees kind of lazy. “There were tired and cold bees that weren’t going from flower to flower the way they wanted them to,” Gerlach said. That, too, meant a smaller crop.           This year, finally, the environment was just right. “We’ve seen pretty ideal conditions,” in the US this year, said India Colegrave, scientific technician of specialty agricultural data at Gro Intelligence. “We have warmer spring temperatures and great soil moisture levels.”           The result? A bounty of fruit.           Washington state, the country’s top apple producer, is expecting to produce 140 million 40-pound boxes of apples for retail this year, according to Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. That’s up sharply from 104 million boxes last year and is also much higher than the roughly 123 million in 2021.           Over the summer, the US Apple Association predicted that the US overall would have 1.5% more apples this season than last.     Cheap gas has made it more affordable for apple growers to ship across state lines, increasing competition between different parts of the country, said Gerlach.           And in general, more apples are staying in the domestic market. In 2019, amid a global trade war, India imposed retaliatory tariffs on a number of products coming from the US, including apples. The tariffs slashed apple exports dramatically. India lifted those extra measures earlier this year, and ultimately the USDA predicts that apple exports to the country “have the potential to climb from $4.8 million in 2022 to $50-$80 million in 2024.”           But it might not be so easy to bounce back, said Lynsee Gibbons, director of communications for the US Apple Association.           “In the years that we’ve had an absence there, they have filled that demand with apples from Turkey and Iran and some other markets,” she said. “Now, the US has… to reacquaint ourselves with that market and get our way back in there.”           The war in Ukraine has also shifted international apple market behavior, said the Washington State Tree Fruit Association’s DeVaney.           “A lot of European apples … had previously gone into Russia and Ukraine,” he said. “They are diverting their crop to other markets in the Middle East and South Asia that were previously prime markets for US and Washington apple exports.”           For farmers, the good crop this year is in many ways a relief. But the lower prices pose yet another challenge to their business.           “This year, we’re all quite concerned,” said Craig Campbell, a third-generation fruit farmer who owns Harmony Orchards in Washington.           “These apples today are being sold close to the cost of production here, in some cases, less than cost of production,” he said. “We have a lot of volume, but I don’t know if we’re gonna be making any money this year.”           Though gas prices have fallen, apple farmers have other rising costs, including labor.           “We’re under a lot of pressure,” said Campbell. “Our input costs are not keeping up with prices this year.”     As the CEO of Land O’Lakes, she’s changing the rules of American farming         In general, pricing has not been trending in a way favorable to farmers, said DeVaney.           Despite recent swings, “we’ve seen fairly stable apple pricing over many years,” he noted. “I’ve talked to growers who go back in their sales records and say, well, 10 years ago, I was getting the same price for my fruit that I am now, in dollars — so no adjustment for inflation.”           From 2008 to now, prices paid to farmers for Red Delicious apples n the Yakima Valley and Wenatchee in Washington have swung up and down but on average remained pretty steady, according to figures from Gro Intelligence. “Current [price] levels are more like the middle of the historical range,” said Jonathan Haines, senior research analyst at Gro Intelligence.           To cope with rising costs and improve sustainability, many farmers have been making adjustments to how they operate, said Todd Fryhover, president of the Washington Apple Commission, which promotes the state’s apple industry.           Some have swapped old varieties for new ones, which can be sold at a premium, packing in more trees per acre when they do so. “We’re trying to utilize our grounds better,” he said. “Our resources are limited, labor is limited, so we’re trying to make our orchards more efficient to reflect those challenges.”           The efforts have increased apple output over time, he said.          But replanting trees and putting in new infrastructure requires investments that some small farmers just can’t afford.           The dynamics have led to more consolidation in the industry, said Fryhover.          “We’re seeing the smaller growers not being able to be competitive,” he said. “They’re either having to get bigger or they’re having to get out.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Small business owners gear up for the biggest shopping weekend of the holiday season,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/small-business-owners-gear-up-for-the-biggest-shopping-weekend-of-the-holiday-season/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            While retail giants like Amazon and Walmart hope for big profits on Black Friday, the less-heralded Small Business Saturday is looking to continue its winning streak for the nearly 32 million small businesses riding a wave of enthusiastic consumer spending and robust government investment.           According to a new American Express survey of small business owners, “55% anticipate Small Business Saturday will make a significant contribution to their overall holiday sales this year.” In a consumer survey conducted by the company in October, half of respondents said they plan to participate in the upcoming Small Business Saturday, and 85% said they anticipated shopping small this holiday season.           Over the past 13 years, the company says consumers have reported spending nearly $184 billion during Small Business Saturday. In a survey conducted by American Express after last year’s Small Business Saturday, 72% of shoppers said that the campaign made them want to shop and dine at small, independent retailers throughout the year. American Express estimated that Small Business Saturday drove nearly $18 billion in consumer spending last year.           Donnell Johns, who runs Veterans Growing America, an organization that supports veteran- and military-spouse-owned small businesses, said that Small Business Saturday is valuable because it creates an awareness for shopping small. “We’ve definitely seen an increase in the amount of people who come out and support small businesses over the last several years,” he said.           For Ken Moorman, founder of Jirani Coffeehouse in Manassas, Virginia, Small Business Saturday means an average 10% uptick in sales than a typical Saturday.           “Prior to Covid, (Small Business Saturday) was huge, and it started to pick back up last year,” Moorman said, adding that he expects even more participation this year. “We all know small businesses are the heartbeat of America. One time of the year, it’s great to remind everybody: Don’t forget the little guy.”           American Express founded the Small Business Saturday campaign in 2010 to encourage holiday shoppers to support local small businesses. It has become a mom-and-pop counterpart to Black Friday, which is often dominated by huge national and multinational corporations. The Small Business Administration has co-sponsored the initiative since 2011, and new federal data indicates that this year’s holiday comes at a particularly good time for small independent entrepreneurs.           “American Express has been a long-time advocate for small businesses – we work to deeply understand them and meet their evolving needs. We also understand the impact shopping small has on supporting local communities through our annual Small Business Saturday and year-round Shop Small campaigns,” Elizabeth Rutledge, American Express’ chief marketing officer, said in a news release last week. “We hope Small Business Saturday and this year’s interactive experience excite and engage shoppers across the country during the kickoff to the important holiday shopping season.”           In a news release Tuesday, the SBA announced it had invested nearly $50 billion to support American small businesses in fiscal year 2023. The SBA said it helped lend $27.5 billion in 7(a) loans; its core lending initiative. In total, the SBA backed more than 57,300 7(a) loans with a maximum of $5 million per loan. In an indication that the somewhat vulnerable small business sector is recovering, 7(a) loans are now above pre-pandemic levels.           “Starting and running a business takes tremendous grit and determination, but it also takes capital — something too many enterprising Americans have historically been unable to obtain equitably and affordably,” SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman said Tuesday in a statement. “The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to simplifying and addressing persistent inequities in accessing capital to ensure all small business owners can get the funding needed to grow and create jobs for our economy … As we build on our progress, the SBA will continue to prioritize reforms that will help level the playing field to further the small business boom fostered by Bidenomics.”           The SBA also said it made headway this past year in supporting minority-owned small businesses.           According to the new federal data, both the number and dollar-value of loan to Black-owned businesses have doubled under the Biden administration. In fiscal year 2023 alone, the SBA insured 4,700 of these loans totaling $1.5 billion. That’s in addition to 7,700 loans to small businesses owned by Latinos, 7,500 to those owned by Asian American and Pacific Islanders, and 500 to those run by indigenous Americans.           The SBA also backed $5 billion dollars worth of loans for women-owned businesses, and $1.2 billion for veteran-owned ones.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,US home sales on pace for the worst year since 1993,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/homes/october-home-sales-fell-on-high-mortgage-rates-soaring-prices-and-low-inventory/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Home sales may have their worst year in 30 years. Sales slumped in October and prices continued to climb, as mortgage rates surged last month and inventory remained extraordinarily low. That kept homebuyers out of the market, according to a monthly report from the National Association of Realtors released Tuesday.           Home sales remained at 13-year lows as buyers competed for the few available homes on the market and continued to push up prices. Elevated prices, together with the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage nearing 8% in October, have created the least affordable market in several decades.     The median price for existing homes — which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops — climbed to $391,800 last month. That was up 3.4% from a year ago and marked the fourth consecutive month of year-over-year price increases. It was the highest median price on record for the month of October. Prices rose in all four regions of the country, the Northeast, Midwest, South and the West, NAR found.           Higher costs to buy and finance a home pushed sales down to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 3.79 million, falling 4.1% from September and a 14.6% from a year ago, according to the report. This fell short of analysts’ expectations for a rate of 3.9 million units sold. Home sales slid from last month in the Northeast, South and West, but were unchanged in the Midwest.           “Prospective home buyers experienced another difficult month due to the persistent lack of housing inventory and the highest mortgage rates in a generation,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Multiple offers, however, are still occurring, especially on starter and mid-priced homes, even as price concessions are happening in the upper end of the market.”           Of the homes sold in October, 28% went above the listing price, which suggests there was a bidding war among would-be buyers.           “There are lingering effects of multiple offers, with more people waiving home inspection and appraisal contingencies,” said Yun. “Given the lack of inventory home sellers are in driver seat, they like the offers that waive those contingencies.”           In October, 24% home buyers waived home inspections, a year ago it was 20%; 21% waived appraisal contingency, compared to 18% a year ago.           Home sales were down in lower priced categories – under $750,000 – due to lack of inventory and sales grew in higher price categories where there was more inventory.           “Where there is more inventory more sales can get done,” said Yun.           Inventory of homes for sale at the end October was 1.15 million units, which was up 1.8% from September. Typical inventory levels prior to the pandemic was about 1.9 million, meaning there were about half the number of homes for sale compared to pre-Covid.           Properties typically remained on the market for 23 days in October, up from 21 days in September 2023 and October 2022. Over half of homes sold in last month were on the market for less than a month.           First-time buyers were responsible for 28% of sales in October.           “First time buyers are still not able to crack above 30% on a consistent basis,” said Yun.           All-cash sales accounted for 29% of transactions in October, unchanged from September but up from 26% in October 2022.           “The lack of inventory and higher interest rates really hitting the home sales market,” said Yun. “Maybe in a couple months we will see some improvement in affordability.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Kim Kardashian is investing in the maker of truffle-infused condiments,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/kim-kardashian-truff-investment/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Kim Kardashian’s private equity firm has announced its first investment: A company that makes truffle-infused sauces that sell for about $20 a bottle.     SKKY Partners, the company she formed last year with a former executive at Carlyle Group, has acquired a “significant minority stake” in Truff sauces. The six-year-old brand has recently grown in popularity for its condiments that extends from hot sauce to mayonnaise.           In a press release Tuesday, SKKY called Truff a “premium flavor-enhancement brand” and said that its “distinctive flavor, high-quality ingredients, new product innovation and social following” have made the brand an attractive investment target.           “Truff is exactly the kind of business that embodies what we were looking for when we founded SKKY — a next-generation brand with a deep, authentic connection with consumers and the potential for ongoing growth,” Kardashian said. “We’re proud to be kicking off the SKKY portfolio with this investment.”           Launched in 2017, Truff has expanded beyond its direct-to-consumer model and now sells its sauces at Target, Whole Foods and Publix. The sauce brand has recently had high-profile collaborations with Taco Bell for a custom hot sauce and Hidden Valley for a special dressing.           The transaction also includes adding Mark Ramadan, the cofounder and former CEO of Sir Kensington’s condiments, to Truff’s board. He helped sell that brand, best known for its fancy ketchups, for a reported $140 million in 2017 to Unilever.           Financial terms of Truff’s deal with SKKY weren’t disclosed and is expected to close early next year.           SKKY’s investment is a “big vote of confidence in the business and its founders,” according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.           “Truff has been one of the growth stars of the consumer packaged goods world and has managed to boost its appeal and reach without sacrificing the more premium positioning of its brand,” Saunders told CNN. He added that the addition of Ramadan is a “major benefit” because of his “very strong pedigree in consumer goods.”     Kim Kardashian reveals the ‘magic’ of her success to CNN’s Poppy Harlow         Kardashian started SKKY in 2022 with Jay Sammons, a 16-year veteran of global private equity firm Carlyle. However, it hadn’t made any investments and had remained largely quiet on its ambitions until now.           SKKY said in a release that the firm’s “primary focus is on identifying culturally relevant brands that forge deep emotional connections with their target consumers and offer those consumers coveted products and services.”            Investment targets include companies in health and wellness, food and beverage as well as apparel.           Kardashian’s business expertise extends beyond private equity. Skims, her underwear and apparel brand, recently launched a line for men. Expanding beyond a customer base of women is a possible prelude to an initial public offering for the company; however, nothing has officially been announced.

business,"Lowe’s, Best Buy and Kohl’s predict a weak holiday",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/best-buy-lowes-kohls-holiday-shopping/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Shoppers will be splurging less this holiday than in past years, major retailers say.           Best Buy, Lowe’s and Kohl’s all reported sales declines during their most recent quarter Tuesday and are forecasting holiday sales to drop from a year ago.           “Consumer demand has been even more uneven and difficult to predict,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in a statement, noting that the company “prepared for a customer who is very deal-focused.”           Holiday sales are predicted to grow this year but at a slower rate.           In 2021, Holiday shopping sales spiked by 14% and grew by a healthy 5% last year. But Moody’s Investors Service said in a report today that consumers are “losing spending steam” and holiday sales will grow by just 1% to 3% this year.           Shoppers have become more cautious in the face of inflation, higher interest rates and the resumption of student loan repayments.     Chains are using theft to mask other issues, report says         Moody’s analysts say the high cost of living and dwindling savings will cause low and middle income consumers to shrink their holiday budgets.           Many customers are pulling back on major discretionary purchases like TVs and furniture and have shifted to focus on essentials. Walmart, Costco and discount clothing stores such as TJ Maxx could benefit from shoppers seeking out value, Moody’s said.           “Retailers offering a combination of value and non-discretionary essentials will see their sales outperform the broader retail industry this holiday season,” according to Moody’s.           Since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, retailers have started Black Friday deals earlier than ever to draw shoppers.           “One trend that’s sticking is a longer holiday season. Christmas creep has gotten particularly pronounced,” said Berna Barshay, an independent retail analyst.           Retailers have also been dealing with higher losses from shoplifting.           But there are signs that these problems could be easing.           Dick’s Sporting Goods in August blamed an “increasingly serious” theft problem for its profit plunge. But the company reported Tuesday that its profit bounced back this quarter.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,"As the CEO of Land O’Lakes, she’s changing the rules of American farming",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/economy/beth-ford-risk-taker/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            In 2023, the surge in responsible investing hit a wall.           Environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives buckled under the pressure of economic and political forces, including efforts by congressional Republicans and conservative-led states to limit “woke” investments that prioritize “agendas and ideology.”         But in America’s Heartland, a century-old dairy cooperative and Fortune 500 firm continues to double down on its sustainability-focused investments in the land and in rural communities.           At the helm of Land O’Lakes is Beth Ford, the first woman to lead the $19 billion Arden Hills, Minnesota, cooperative, which has 9,000 employees and 2,809 member-owners.           Since 2018, when she became chief executive of one of the country’s biggest producers of butter and cheese, Ford has tapped the collective mindset of the company’s farmers, retailers and producers to unabashedly launch initiatives to further rural broadband access, reduce the company’s﻿ carbon footprint, address food supply concerns and promote environmental stewardship.           At a time when social and environmental investments have been politicized, Ford and Land O’Lakes are staying the course.           Those efforts simply make good business sense, she told CNN.           “We’re focusing on the things that are most important to our members, their families and to their businesses,” she told CNN. “And from my perspective, I don’t get involved in politics. We don’t talk politics. We talk policies that are enablers for farmers, for the food supply.”           “I talk about trade,” she added: “I talk about the strength of the US dollar … I talk about [how] my responsibility is to make evident to everybody the things that we need to do to continue to invest, to be protective for all of us in our food supply.”           Under Ford, Land O’Lakes deepened its investments in Truterra, a subsidiary that bridges data-driven technology with sustainability practices. When Truterra was launched in 2016 under the name SUSTAIN, the business unit explored initiatives such as feed additives to reduce methane emissions from animals, a plastics recycling process and public-private partnerships to reduce water usage and improve soil health.           In 2021, Truterra started a program in which it offered upfront cash payments to farmers who sequestered carbon, which involves capturing and storing greenhouse gases naturally produced by plants.           Paying out $20,000 on average and up to $100,000 in certain cases, Truterra paid farmers $4 million in its first year for the sequestering of 200,000 metric tons of carbon. In 2022, those payouts grew to $5 million for 273 farmers participating.           “We have agronomists, we have one of the first-of-its-kind data models, so we’re working with farmers directly, and it’s about practice change,” Ford said. “And so it’s not really a buzzword, it makes the land more resilient. It makes the farmer more resilient for climate change.”           In her role, Ford said she has become a fierce advocate for science and technology, both on the corporate side as well as in the regions that produce the nation’s food.           In August, the US Environmental Protection Agency lauded Land O’Lakes as a leader in on-farm sustainability initiatives that help members balance profit and their environmental goals. The EPA and the Hershey Company gave $2 million to Land O’Lakes member farms in Pennsylvania.           “I like to mention that 18% to 19% of the population lives in rural America, and they comprise 47% to 48% of the military,” she said. “These are families that are invested in this country, they are constantly doing what is necessary and hard. I admire our farmers, our members. I will be a loud advocate on their behalf because I think it is right for all of us as American citizens.”     Throughout her life and career, Ford has long drawn inspiration from her mother.           Ford’s mother, Carol, held critical caregiving roles both professionally — as a nurse, a therapist and a minister — and personally, raising eight children with her husband on a working-class budget.           That resilience, humility and work ethic became deeply engrained in Ford, who was the fifth of eight children in the Sioux City, Iowa, family.           In a 2018 interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow, Ford recalled how her mother told her that “while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.”           “She said, ‘Do you understand what is expected of you? Do you understand how much you have? Don’t disappoint,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve got to work hard to not disappoint,’” Ford told Harlow at the time.           From the age of 12 and through college, Ford held a variety of jobs, including roles in detasseling corn, babysitting, working as a night cashier and cleaning toilets.           The versatility went on to define her nearly 40-year career, at seven companies —  including Pepsi, Mobil and Scholastic — in six industries.           “I think that the biggest risk I’ve taken professionally is I’ve moved when I thought I needed to learn something,” she said. “I’ve been in business now for 37 years, and many times I wasn’t familiar with the industry. I don’t think one summer of detasseling corn makes me a farm expert.”           She added: “So, the risk is the willingness to be embarrassed, the willingness to leverage your curiosity, to admire the folks who do know and to feel confident and that it’s OK to say, ‘I don’t know. I need your help. Can you help me understand this?’”           But early on at Land O’Lakes, Ford also sought to leverage her past experience in other industries to chart a vision for the company: that it is a leader in not just butter but also ag-tech.           In 2020, Land O’Lakes convened the American Connection Project coalition to advocate for public and private investment in high-speed internet infrastructure in rural communities. The coalition, which eventually grew to more than 175 members, saw some of its advocacy efforts realized in the passage of the Biden administration’s bipartisan infrastructure bill.           Ford said the coalition is part of her commitment to push for investments that protect the food supply and the people who produce it.            In agriculture, and especially in commodity-centric businesses such as dairy, change is constant — whether that’s climate events, geopolitical conflict or trade disruptions.           But incorporating environmentally sustainable practices or initiatives isn’t always the easiest sell, said Lucas Fuess, economist and senior daily analyst at Rabobank’s RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness team.           Many shareholders and prominent politicians, especially in redder states, have been vocal against ESG practices. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds made anti-ESG investing a focus for the 2023 legislative session, calling the investments “not only legally suspect” but “financially reckless.”           Earlier this year, nearly two dozen state attorneys general — many of them from agriculture-heavy states like Iowa, Idaho, Kansas and more — warned more than 50 of the country’s largest asset managers against investments “corrupted in favor of a radical social agenda.”           With “ESG” and related initiatives in the crosshairs, that means Ford’s efforts carry risks for herself, for her company, for the co-op members and even the buyers browsing their grocery store shelves.           For those efforts to be successful, companies and entities have to be on the same page from the farmer level to the co-op level to even the retail and consumer, Fuess said.           “A lot of times in tackling sustainability challenges or ESG challenges requires a cost, and I think there’s a lot of discussion on, ‘Where does that money come from?’ and ‘How do we make sure at the end of the day we’re also economically sustainable?’” he said.           “I think there continues to be discussions on whether this is something the consumer will have to pay for, or something that has to be absorbed by the processor … or pushed onto farmers to bear,” he said.           At the same time, there’s also great potential, he said.           “For as much as this is challenging in discussing, I think there’s also an incredible amount of opportunity that can come out of this in working toward these goals and reducing emissions and seeing real accomplishments, and we could hopefully have a really, really good story to tell as the years flow by.”           In Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Kelly Garrett has long been a champion of regenerative farming practices. In 2020, he gained media attention for selling carbon credits on the open market. He sold credits for the estimated 22,745 tons of carbon he removed from the atmosphere from 2014-2019 using those farming practices.           “The way I looked at it was this is free money for things that I’m already doing and already believed in, and I believe in them [economically],” Garrett told CNN.           The attention from his sale eventually led him to Truterra, which appealed to Garrett because of its backing from Land O’Lakes.           “The carbon market has kind of been like the wild, wild West, because it’s a little bit unregulated,” he said. “A lot of carbon companies are startups, and they don’t have decent funding. And when the funding dries up, the ethics can kind of dry up.”           The weight and financial backing of a century-old cooperative in Land O’Lakes brings an element of security to a practice that some farmers are skeptical of, because they may have been burned in the past, Garrett said.           “Let’s be honest here, I farm the way I farm because I think it’s financially the best thing,” he said. “And when I speak to other farmers, I talk about my high-yield path and my sustainable path. The two paths are converging, because we’re trying to farm more in tune with Mother Nature.”           In addition to investing in Truterra as well as agriculture technology and economics, Land O’Lakes and Ford remain active and vocal on topics such as agriculture research funding and immigration reform at the federal level.           Those types of efforts and investments are especially critical at a time when weather is getting more extreme, water is growing more precious, worker shortages hamper productivity, persistent inflation saps profits and loans are not only more expensive but also harder to come by, Ford said.           “The concern sometimes that I have is that there isn’t an understanding of what is required in the food system, the interconnected nature, the fact that we all need to focus on this,” she said. “This isn’t a rural/urban issue, this is an American issue. This is important to all of us.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes. All times are ET.

business,Elon Musk is now boosting the ‘Pizzagate’ conspiracy theory,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/tech/elon-musk-boosting-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Elon Musk on Monday boosted the dangerous, years-old “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, just days after being roundly criticized and facing an advertiser exodus following his embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory.     Elon Musk’s X sues media watchdog Media Matters over report on pro-Nazi content on the social media site         In a post Monday, an X user attempted to link the founder of Media Matters — the progressive media watchdog that last week identified ads for major brands running alongside pro-Nazi content on X — to the owner of the “Pizzagate restaurant.” Musk replied: “Weird.” By replying, Musk called the post to the attention of his more than 160 million followers on X.     Pizzagate is an anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory that spun up on 4chan, Reddit, Twitter and other platforms in the final days before the 2016 US presidential election. Believers imagined a pedophilia ring supposedly being run out of a Washington, DC pizza shop that involved Clinton and other Democrats.           The wildly false claims were behind self-appointed “investigator” Edgar Maddison Welch’s decision in December of that year to fire an assault rifle inside the restaurant. (No one was hurt, and Welch later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years in prison.)           It’s just the latest conspiracy theory Musk has drawn attention to using X. Musk last week agreed with an antisemitic post on his social media platform X, endorsing the claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” Musk last year also gave credence to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, by posting a link to an article full of baseless claims about Paul Pelosi.           Musk last week faced backlash from the White House and others for engaging with an antisemitic conspiracy theory.           “It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of Antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.           On Friday, at least a half dozen major advertisers, including media giants Disney, Paramount and NBCUniversal, halted their spending on X. IBM also suspended advertising on the platform after the Media Matters report showed its ad appeared alongside pro-Nazi content.           Musk has pushed back at idea that he is antisemitic. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said in a post Sunday. Musk’s company has also claimed that Media Matters’ report was misleading and that it has taken steps to combat antisemitism and discrimination on the platform. X on Monday sued Media Matters, accusing it of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X.           However, X has not removed the pro-Nazi accounts mentioned in Media Matters’ report, instead saying that their posts had little engagement and that they would no longer be eligible for monetization.

business,Pro-Nazi posts next to Apple ads: Elon Musk’s X sues watchdog for its damning report,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/tech/x-sues-media-matters/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            After a devastating advertiser exodus last week involving some of the world’s largest media companies, X owner Elon Musk is suing the progressive watchdog group Media Matters over its analysis highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X — a report that appeared to play a significant role in the massive and highly damaging brand revolt.           The lawsuit filed Monday accuses Media Matters of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X, alleging that the group’s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site.           “Media Matters knowingly and maliciously manufactured side-by-side images depicting advertisers’ posts on X Corp.’s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist fringe content and then portrayed these manufactured images as if they were what typical X users experience on the platform,” the complaint filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas said. “Media Matters designed both these images and its resulting media strategy to drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.”           The lawsuit marks the latest example of Musk’s favored response to his critics, and seeks to direct blame for the advertiser backlash onto third-party groups after Musk, in the same week, publicly endorsed the antisemitic claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”           The lawsuit simultaneously names Media Matters and Eric Hananoki, its senior investigative reporter, as defendants. It calls for a judicial order forcing Media Matters to remove its analysis from its website and accuses Media Matters of interfering with X’s contracts with advertisers, of disrupting their economic relationships and of unlawfully disparaging X.           In a statement Monday evening, Media Matters President Angelo Carusone vowed to defend the group against the suit.           “This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X’s critics into silence,” Carusone said. “Media Matters stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.”           On Monday evening, X CEO Linda Yaccarino chimed in defending the social media site.           “If you know me, you know I’m committed to truth and fairness,” Yaccarino posted. “Here’s the truth. Not a single authentic user on X saw IBM’s, Comcast’s, or Oracle’s ads next to the content in Media Matters’ article.”           Following the lawsuit’s filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton piled on, announcing he would be investigating Media Matters to determine whether its study of content on X might constitute “potential fraudulent activity” under Texas law. He also called the group a “radical left-wing organization” that “would like nothing more than to limit freedom by reducing participation in the public square.”           And Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey posted on X that his office was also investigating Media Matters, news to which Musk responded: “Great!”           Musk had teased the litigation on Saturday after major brands including Disney, Paramount and CNN’s parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, halted their advertising on X. Musk threatened a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against Media Matters and “ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company,” including, he said in a follow-up post, “their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them…”           In previewing X’s argument, Musk appeared not to dispute the results of Media Matters’ analysis, instead targeting the group for having created a test account and allegedly refreshing the account until X’s advertising systems ran an ad for a major brand beside extremist content. The result generated by the test would almost never happen in the real world, Musk’s complaint alleged.           Legal experts on technology and the First Amendment widely characterized X’s complaint on Monday as weak and opportunistically filed in a court that Musk likely believes will take his side.           “It’s one of those lawsuits that’s filed more for symbolism than for substance—as reflected in just how empty the allegations really are, and in where Musk chose to file, singling out the ultra-conservative Northern District of Texas despite its absence of any logical connection to the dispute,” said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst. “The choice of venue can best be described as trying to shore up a weak claim on the merits with a bench more likely to be sympathetic even to weak claims.”           “This reads like a press release, not a court filing to me,” said Joan Donovan, a professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University. “X does admit the ads were shown next to hateful content, but argues it was ‘rare.’ This is the same strategy employed by advertisers that got YouTube to demonetize political content in 2017.”           One legal expert said the lawsuit could backfire.           “This lawsuit is riddled with legal flaws, and it is highly ironic that a platform that touts itself as a beacon of free speech would file a bogus case like this that flatly contradicts basic First Amendment principles and targets free speech by a critic,” First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous told CNN. “And in some ways it’s a dream come true for the people at Media Matters because it could allow them to use the litigation discovery process to force X to divulge all sorts of embarrassing, damaging private information that it would much rather keep secret.”           Ken White, a First Amendment lawyer and criminal defense attorney based in Los Angeles, said the decision to file in Texas may have been intended to circumvent laws passed by California, the District of Columbia and dozens of states barring frivolous lawsuits meant to stifle public criticism.           “X filed this in federal court in Texas to avoid application of an anti-SLAPP statute,” White said on the X alternative BlueSky, using the acronym that refers to so-called “strategic lawsuits against public participation.”           In the federal appeals court that oversees Texas, anti-SLAPP statutes do not apply, White added.           “X’s purpose is to harass and abuse and maximize the cost of litigation, and anti-SLAPP statutes interfere with that aim,” he wrote.           Monday’s case has been assigned to District Judge Mark Pittman, a Donald Trump appointee who has previously been at the center of some of the nation’s biggest legal battles. Last November, Pittman blocked President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt, one of two such decisions to reach the Supreme Court.           Last August, Pittman ruled that a Texas law that bans people ages 18 to 20 from carrying handguns in public is unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Second Amendment and US history.

business,"It’s ‘pathological’ for brands to advertise on Elon Musk’s X, Yale professor says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/pathological-brands-advertise-elon-musks-x-yale-professor-says/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News             Brands are being “irresponsible” by continuing to advertise on Elon Musk’s X after the billionaire endorsed antisemitic views, according to Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.           “It’s self-destructive for any advertiser to be associated with him. It’s pathological,” Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN in a phone interview.           Musk set off another round of controversy last week by agreeing with an antisemitic post on X that claimed Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” Musk responded by saying: “You have said the actual truth.”           Some major brands have halted advertising on X (formerly known as Twitter), including Disney, NBCUniversal and CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Those advertisers did not specifically say the decision was linked to Musk’s post, though some of their ads were found to be placed near antisemitic posts on X, according to a report by progressive watchdog group Media Matters.         “There should be no public company advertising on Twitter. You can’t have someone endorsing replacement theory and be associated with that,” said Sonnenfeld. (Replacement theory, popularized in far-right White nationalist circles, argues Democrats and liberals are plotting to import undocumented immigrants to reduce the political power of White people.)           Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, responded by telling CNN in an email: “Jeffrey Sonnenfeld must not believe in free speech.”           In a blog post on Friday, X accused Media Matters of aggressively searching for pro-Nazi content in a way that “misrepresented the real user experience” and could “mislead advertisers.” Musk has also filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, a legal battle that the group says it can win.           The advertiser backlash is piling even more financial pressure on X at a time when the social media platform has been struggling. And it’s causing another massive headache for X CEO Linda Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal executive who joined the company earlier this year to help boost its ad business.           “Linda Yaccarino should resign,” Sonnenfeld said in the interview. “As talented as she is, unless she can force (Musk) to recant his words, which he’s not going to do, she should give up.”           Some advertisers are trying to persuade Yaccarino to do just that.           Marketing industry veteran Lou Paskalis previously told CNN there has been a “groundswell” of ad execs urging Yaccarino to step down.           However, Yaccarino has signaled she doesn’t plan to quit, posting on Monday morning: “I believe deeply in our vision, our team and our community.”           Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate governance, argues the free market will sort out the mess at X.           “This is a perfect opportunity for the market to do what the market does best,” Minow said. “If advertisers don’t want to put an ad in an environment that won’t enhance their product, they will withdraw. It’s like: Do you want to have your ads run in Time Magazine or Hustler?”           Even though X is no longer a public company, Minow said there could still be consequences for Musk.           “If other investors and those who hold the debt start to feel iffy about the financial prospects, they will hold him accountable,” Minow said.           Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said brands don’t need to “completely agree” with a media property and its policies to advertise there.           Still, Calkins said it’s becoming increasingly hard to separate Musk from X’s controversial comments and noted concerns about how the social media platform polices content.           “The last thing a brand wants is to spend money to unintentionally get pulled into a polarizing topic,” Calkins said.

business,Aaron Josefczyk/UPI/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/business/labor-costs-impact-car-price/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            The new labor contracts between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will make a big difference in the paychecks of 145,000 autoworkers. It will raise their pay at least 11% immediately, and likely more than 30% over the life of the contract. But it’s not going to make much difference in the prices you have to pay when buying your next car.           “The labor contracts don’t mean you go to a dealership and the car costs more money,” said Ivan Drury, analyst for sales tracker Edmunds. “If wages go up 11%, an overnight change in prices is not realistic. The end result is that for the consumers, the labor cost doesn’t mean a lot.”           Part of the reason is that labor makes up only about 7% of the overall cost of building a car. Raw materials, like the steel and aluminum in the bodywork, the rubber in the tires and the dozens of computer chips that control so many aspects of a modern auto, have a much greater impact.           But the fact is that the three unionized automakers still have to compete in the market with nonunion automakers. Ford, GM, and Stellantis account for less than half of US vehicle sales.           And even though some of those nonunion automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai have announced their own pay increases in the wake of the UAW deal, perhaps due to concerns about the threat of the UAW organizing their own employees, though there are still plenty of automakers who are not raising wages.           If the Big Three could simply pass along higher costs, be it raw material, labor other expenses, in the form of higher prices, no automaker would ever lose money. That’s clearly not reality.           “The automakers will have difficulty passing those costs onto consumers,” said Michelle Krebs, analyst with Cox Automotive.           Even if the labor costs could be passed along in terms of higher prices, it woudn’t be nearly as much as you might think. The labor deal is likely to raise the cost of building vehicles by $950 per car, according to Ford CFO John Lawler. But that $950 is the total increased cost from the labor contracts that will be paid over the course of four-and-a-half years of the contract. Or about $200 more per year, with less of that increased expense coming in the near term and more at the end of the contract.           Any additional labor costs are more likely to eat into automaker profits than they are to raise prices. Ford reported that it earned about $3,000 before interest and taxes for every gas or hybrid vehicle sold to consumers in the first 9 months of the year. So a few hundred dollars a year in higher labor costs aren’t going to break the companies, or send them back to the massive losses that they experienced in the first decade of this century.           Car prices are driven far more by supply and demand than by the cost of the vehicle. The average transaction price reached $48,760 in October, according to Edmunds’ data. That’s less than $50 below the record average car price set in December of 2022, and it’s up about $10,600, or 28%, from the average price in October 2017.           That substantial price increase was not driven by an increase in costs, labor or otherwise. It was driven mostly by strong demand for autos, and a limited supply of vehicles due to the shortage of some parts, most notably computer chips.           That led to a period in which most buyers were being forced to pay above the manufacturers’ suggested retail price, or “sticker price.” In past years, very few car buyers ever had to pay above sticker price for a car.           Most American new car buyers aren’t actually buying directly from automakers, but from dealerships, which are independent businesses that buy cars in bulk from automakers at wholesale prices, and sell them at whatever price the market will bear.           Another factor driving car prices higher was the desire of consumers to buy cars with more features and options that are now available but were not available in the past. And the demand for those extra features are among the factors raising the average price of a car, even if the price of the most basic, stripped down models have not increased as rapidly.

business,"Major advertisers flee X, deepening crisis at Elon Musk’s social media site",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/tech/lionsgate-suspends-advertising-x-musk/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            A torrent of prominent brands halted their advertising on X on Friday, dealing a massive reputational blow to Elon Musk’s social media company after his public embrace this week of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.           The high-profile advertiser revolt includes some of the world’s largest media companies, such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of CNN.           X also reportedly lost Apple, according to multiple news outlets including Axios, which first reported Apple’s withdrawal.           Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment.           The dizzying pace and scope of the withdrawals from X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, comes amid a widening backlash against Musk for his increasingly vocal endorsement of extremist beliefs.           And it casts fresh doubts on the future of a business that Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino had vowed would become profitable once more as early as next year.           The companies’ advertising pauses follow a similar move by IBM on Thursday.           Ads for IBM and other major brands were found appearing alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform, according to a report on Thursday by progressive media watchdog group Media Matters. In a statement, IBM explicitly called out what it described as an “entirely unacceptable situation.”           “IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” an IBM spokesperson said.           In a blog post responding to Friday’s brand exodus, X accused Media Matters of aggressively searching for pro-Nazi content in a way that “misrepresented the real user experience” and could “mislead advertisers.” The company noted that the pro-Nazi posts cited in the report had little engagement; one of the posts mentioned has since had its visibility reduced under X’s “Freedom of Speech, not Reach” policy.           In a post on X early Saturday morning, Musk threatened a lawsuit against Media Matters. The group’s president responded in a statement to CNN, saying, “If he does sue us, we will win.”           “Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully who threatens meritless lawsuits in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate,” Media Matters President Angelo Carusone said in the statement. “Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified.”           In a social media post on Friday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote that “X has been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There’s absolutely no place for it anywhere in the world.”           “At risk of stating the obvious, anyone advocating the genocide of *any* group will be suspended from this platform,” Musk wrote on X Friday evening.           An analysis by the watchdog group Media Matters found this week that in addition to IBM, ads by Apple, Comcast, NBC and Oracle had appeared alongside similar content.           Spokespersons for Oracle have not responded to requests for comment.           A spokesperson for X said the pro-Nazi accounts identified in Thursday’s Media Matters report would no longer be eligible for monetization, meaning ads would no longer be run on those pages.           In August, two other brands, NCTA — the Internet and Television Association — and Gilead Sciences paused their spending on X after their ads were also run alongside pro-Nazi content.

business,A record number of $50 bills were printed last year. It’s not why you think,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/economy/historic-number-of-50-bills-were-printed-last-year/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Unless you’re an avid currency collector, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, or work at the Federal Reserve, you likely didn’t know that last year a record number of $50 bills were printed.           Last year, the government printed 756,096,000 of those bills — the highest total of the denomination printed in one year in more than 40 years. If you put all those $50s together, you’d have about $37.8 billion. That’s enough to afford Taco Bell’s parent Yum Brands, Inc. $35.3 billion market cap.           Usually, the $50 bill is an uncommon, somewhat unpopular, denomination. There are even multiple superstitions that it is unlucky. (More on that later.) In 2019, only 3.5% of all US bills printed were $50s. In 2022, that zoomed to 8.5%, according to the BEP.           So why are you seeing more $50s? Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with inflation — even if it may sometimes feel these days like an item that used to cost $20 now costs $50. (Luckily, the rate at which inflation has grown slowed to 3.2% in October from its peak of 9.1% last June.)           Instead, it all began with the pandemic. People started hoarding cash, the Fed discovered. And it’s easier to squirrel away bigger bills.           In July 2021, the Fed noted its “2022 print order is heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic… the Federal Reserve continues to experience unprecedented demand for currency.”           A subsequent report from the San Francisco Fed confirmed that, after 2020, Americans began to carry more cash in their wallets, cars, houses and elsewhere.           So, the Fed ordered a big uptick in $50s. Until the pandemic, the $50 had been one of the rarest bills ordered for years, save for the $2 bill. But for 2021 and 2022, the Fed ordered up more $50s than $10s and $5s.           To understand why so many $50 bills were printed, it’s important to know how the system of printing money works. The Fed doesn’t print any physical money itself; it estimates the anticipated demand for currency and the rate of decay of bills already in circulation. Then, it orders the money from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the government agency that prints paper money. The US Mint produces coins.           Few people really love the $50. There’s an old superstition that, because President Ulysses S. Grant is on the face of the $50, and he notoriously went bankrupt, the bills are jinxed. (The $50 bill dates to 1862, but Grant’s face wasn’t added until 1914.)           Back in 2010, North Carolina Republican Representative Patrick McHenry even attempted to introduce a measure into Congress to replace 18th President Grant with 40th President Ronald Reagan. The effort got some support but ultimately went nowhere.           Professional gamblers and casinos reportedly don’t like to carry the bills, considering them a jinx and partially because Las Vegas casino investor and gangster Bugsy Siegel was rumored to have died with only $50s in his pocket.           But, more likely, and more realistically, people tend to avoid using $50 bills due to them being confused with $5 or $20 bills and many stores not accepting bills larger than $20.           A surge in demand for physical money amid a lockdown might not make sense at first glance. Especially given that, as Covid-19 set in, businesses across the United States closed their customer-facing storefronts temporarily and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged the use of cash.           But demand for physical cash and actually paying with cash are two separate things, according to analysts at the San Francisco Fed. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty naturally causes unease, prompting many people to hold on to cash that they may not immediately try and spen, they concluded.           Their data also shows Americans are using physical cash less in daily purchases, and the amount being held by consumers still remains elevated when compared to before the pandemic.           The printing of various denominations has returned to normal levels this year, as shown by the Fed’s 2023 and 2024 print orders. The Fed in its 2023 order said its primary driver now in currency orders is the need to replace damaged notes ($50s last 12.2 years on average, according to the Fed; dollar bills last about half as long.)           The Fed placed its 2024 currency order in July, with an anticipated volume of $50 bills in the range of 99,200,000 to 211,200,000 notes, less than one-third of the 2022 printing.           But cash holdings for American households remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic times, the San Francisco Fed report shows, noting that consumers “continue to hold a significant amount of cash that may be unlikely to be used for daily purchases.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Target is testing a new self-checkout policy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/business/target-self-checkout-new-system/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Target is testing a new self-checkout policy as retailers are finding the cashier-less technology can put off customers.           At a handful of stores, Target has restricted self-checkout to customers buying 10 items or fewer. Customers buying more than that are required to use full-service lanes with cashiers.           A Target spokesperson said the test was designed to shorten wait times and “better understand” shoppers’ preferences.           “Our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team,” Target Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a call with analysts Tuesday about the changes. The company has “refocused” its checkout areas and since seen a 6% increase in customers using full-service cashier lanes across its stores.           Target and other retailers had expanded self-checkout machines in recent years. Self-checkout was designed to help companies save on labor costs and speed up checkout for shoppers.           But the promise of self-checkout hasn’t always played out.           Self-checkout machines sometimes break. Customers often face errors and glitches scanning items, requiring employees to come over and assist them. This erases potential labor savings and makes self-checkout slower, in some cases, than full-service checkout — the problem it was supposed to resolve.           “Our customers have told us this over time — that the self-scan machines that we’ve got in our stores … can be slow, they can be unreliable [and] they’re obviously impersonal,” an executive at Booths supermarket chain told the BBC. Booths recently removed self-checkout on all but two of its 28 stores. Walmart, Costco, Shoprite and other chains have also revised their self-checkout strategies.           Notably, retailers lose more possible sales with self-checkout than full-service cashiers, both from intentional shoplifting and honest errors by customers. One study of retailers in the United States, Britain and other European countries found that companies with self-checkout lanes and apps had a loss rate of about 4%, more than double the industry average.           Target said that merchandise losses, known as shrink, were not a factor in testing new self-checkout policies.           Target has pointed to theft, both petty shoplifting and organized groups of criminals stealing merchandise and reselling it online, as responsible for the increase in losses. (More than 60% of shrink includes employee theft, damaged products, administrative errors, vendor fraud and other factors.)           “Shrink remains a significant financial headwind,” Target finance chief Michael Fiddelke said Tuesday.

In response, Musk said: “You have said the actual truth.”           The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups and echoed by Robert Bowers, the convicted killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. It was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.           Musk, in subsequent posts, said he does not believe hatred of White people extends “to all Jewish communities.” But he said the Anti-Defamation League “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel.

business,"With antisemitic tweet, Elon Musk reveals his ‘actual truth’",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/business/elon-musk-reveals-his-actual-truth/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News        Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.         Elon Musk has publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular among White supremacists: that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”           That kind of overt thumbs up to an antisemitic post shocked even some of Musk’s critics, who have long called him out for using racist or otherwise bigoted dog whistles on Twitter, now known as X. It was the multibillionaire’s most explicit public statement yet endorsing anti-Jewish views.     ICYMI: Musk was responding to a post Wednesday that said Jewish communities “have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” The post also referenced “hordes of minorities” flooding Western countries, a popular antisemitic conspiracy theory.           It’s the kind of post you can find easily on X these days, and likely would have gone unnoticed had Musk, with more than 160 million followers, not re-shared the post with the comment: “You have said the actual truth.”           The antisemitic conspiracy theory — which posits that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations — is often espoused by hate groups.           It’s the same conspiracy echoed in the final written words of Robert Bowers, the convicted murderer of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. His last social media post said that a Jewish nonprofit dedicated to aiding refugees “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people.” The mass shooting was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.           Musk, in subsequent posts, expounded on his views. He wrote that he does not believe hatred of White people extends “to all Jewish communities.” But then he singled out the Anti-Defamation League, claiming that it promotes racism against White people.           X did not respond to requests for comment.           In response, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote that “it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.”           Even the White House weighed in on the tweet.           “It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of Antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Friday in a statement. “We condemn this abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms.”           Musk has rarely been so explicit. But as the owner of X, he has chosen to defend racists’ free speech over the targets’ rights to not be harassed, even going so far as to threaten to sue the ADL for defamation after the organization said antisemitism had surged on X after Musk took over the platform more than a year ago.’           There’s no way to know what’s inside Musk’s heart. All we can rely on is what he says and does on his very public, powerful platform. Hate speech, whether uttered by Musk or merely endorsed by him, is amplified when the world’s richest person posts or comments on it.           “It’s doubtful that Musk harbors personal animosity toward Jewish people,” wrote the Atlantic’s Yair Rosenberg earlier this year, regarding another incident in which Musk trumpeted antisemitic statements. “But he is a conspiracy theorist, and the arc of conspiracy is short and bends toward the Jews.”           There are two popular books out now about Musk, one an authorized biography by Walter Isaacson and another an unauthorized story by Ben Mezrich.           Mezrich in recent weeks has told several interviewers about how “Elon Musk broke Twitter, and Twitter broke Elon Musk.”           It’s a punchy line, and in some ways I’m sure it’s accurate. Mezrich describes the way the chaotic Twitter takeover forever marred Musk’s reputation as a modern-day Thomas Edison, with Americans now deeply divided over whether he’s a genius or a hack. Mezrich says that Musk has been personally anguished by the backlash, including getting booed onstage at a comedy show and feeling so depressed that X employees at one point considered calling the police to do a wellness check on him.           The statement may be only half right. There’s plenty of evidence that Musk broke Twitter — gutted it, rebranded it, tanked its revenue, and made it unrecognizable to its most active users. But Musk was at this long before, spreading countless conspiracy theories, particularly around the Covid pandemic.           He bought Twitter so that he could have a space, safe only for himself and his admirers, to broadcast broken ideas.

business,Volvo’s shares crash to all-time low as China’s Geely cuts stake,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/investing/volvo-shares-fall-record-low-after-geely-cuts-stake/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Shares in Volvo Cars tumbled as much as 13% Friday to hit a record low after its biggest shareholder Geely sold part of its stake at a discount to the market value.           China’s largest privately owned carmaker said it had taken the decision to sell 100 million Volvo Cars shares to increase the size of the free float — the proportion of shares available to be traded by the public — as a way to “enhance” the Swedish company’s value.           Jim Rowan, CEO of Volvo Cars, said in a statement: “This increase in our public float and improvement in trading liquidity benefits both new and existing investors. It allows a wider base of shareholders to invest in (the company).”           In a subsequent statement, the Chinese firm, which acquired Volvo Cars in 2010, said it had generated around $350 million from the sale. That means the shares would have sold for about 37 Swedish crowns each, a discount of nearly 10% to their closing price of 40.84 on Thursday.           The transaction reduced Geely’s stake in Volvo Cars by just over 4%. Once the sale is completed on November 21, that stake is expected to amount to 78.7%, Geely said in the statement. The proceeds will be used to fund Geely’s global business development, it added.     Renault and China’s Geely will invest up to $7.7 billion to build hybrid and gas engines         The attempt to boost the value of Volvo Cars’ stock — which has fallen almost 23% year-to-date — seems to have backfired, at least in the immediate term. The firm’s shares traded down 11% on the day by 10.21 a.m. ET.           Daniel Donghui Li, chief executive of Geely, described Volvo Cars as “one of the world’s fastest-growing carmakers and most iconic car brands” and said Geely was “steadfast” in its commitment to supporting the Swedish company in “its transformation towards becoming a fully electric car maker.”           In 2021, after resistance from investors, Geely scrapped plans to merge with Volvo Cars, which would have created the first Chinese automaker with true global reach. Geely said at the time that the two companies would keep their independent corporate structures but would partner on electric and autonomous driving technology.

business,,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.           Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.           “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.           He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.           Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.            “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”            Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.           “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.     Weddings are booming again. They're bigger and more expensive than ever         “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”            This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.           The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.     Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctions         Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.           Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.           Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.           Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.           Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.            Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora                              (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.            Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.           Signet,                              (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.           Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.            The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.            Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.           “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”           Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.           There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.            So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.            But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.           “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The only noticeable difference is the price tag.           “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.           He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.           Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.            “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”            Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.           “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.     Weddings are booming again. They're bigger and more expensive than ever         “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”            This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.           The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.     Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctions         Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.           Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.           Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.           Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.           Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.            Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora                              (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.            Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.           Signet,                              (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.           Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.            The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.            Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.           “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”           Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.           There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.            So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.            But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.           “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.            Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.           While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.           “Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.           Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.           Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.           To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.           Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.             GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.             There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.            The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.            We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.            BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.           As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.            It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.           The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.            The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.”  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.            There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.            “Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”           That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you.  (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)           The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.            With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.           Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.            “What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.            Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.            “I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”           When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.           The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.            BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.            BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.            Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.           “I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.              BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.                   BeReal                 Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.           “It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”           In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.            “BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,”  the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”           The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.            But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.           “There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.            “It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”             The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.           Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.            Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.            “For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.             “Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes. All times are ET.

business,"BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.           While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.           With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.           This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.           BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.           A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.           Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.           The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.            The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.           Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.           “There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.           Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.           As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.           BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.           Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.           The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.           For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.            The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.           A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.           Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.            A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.           BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/tech/bumble-whitney-wolfe-herd-steps-down-as-ceo/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is stepping down as chief executive after nearly a decade running the dating app company.           Starting on January 2, Wolfe Herd will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a longtime tech executive who has been serving since December as the CEO of the workplace communication service Slack, Bumble confirmed in a securities filing Monday. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as executive chair.           “This move to Executive Chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” Wolfe Herd said in a statement, adding that she and Jones would be “fantastic partners.”           The leadership transition was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.           Wolfe Herd started her career at rival dating service Tinder, which she co-founded. But she left in 2014 and filed a lawsuit against the company alleging sexual harassment and discrimination, which was eventually settled.           She then launched Bumble based on the idea that giving women the chance to make the first move on a dating app would empower them with more control over their romantic lives. Wolfe Herd founded Bumble with the help of Andrey Andreev, the former owner of the dating app Badoo; in 2019, she became head of the combined company after Andreev was accused of racism and sexism.           Today, Bumble is the parent company of four apps — Bumble, Official, Badoo and Fruitz — and the Bumble app has expanded to include features to help people find friends and professional connections. The company has more than 3.6 million paying users across its apps, according to its most recent earnings report.           When Bumble made its initial public offering in 2021, Wolfe Herd, then 31, became one of the world’s youngest self-made female billionaires.           But since then, the company’s share price has foundered. Bumble (BMBL) shares opened trading at $76 dollars on the day of its IPO but are now trading below $14, a more than 80% decline. The company’s stock fell an another 8% on Monday following news of Wolfe Herd’s departure from the CEO role.           Bumble is set to report earnings for the quarter ended in September on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s sales to grow 19% from the year-ago quarter to to $276.9 million, but profits are projected to fall by 31% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv estimates.           Jones will take control of Bumble at a time when analysts are concerned that the uncertain economic environment could make consumers less likely to shell out for dating app subscriptions and as persistent inflation weighs on many tech companies’ earnings. Shares of Match Group, the Bumble competitor and Tinder parent company, tumbled last week after the company said in its earnings report for the September quarter that its number of paying customers had declined by 5% year-over-year. Bumble’s stock also dipped on news of Match’s earnings report.           Before taking over as CEO of Slack late last year, Jones spent four years in various executive roles at Slack parent company Salesforce, most recently as executive vice president of digital experiences. Prior to Salesforce, Jones was the vice president of software product management at speaker company Sonos and spent 12 years at Microsoft. Jones will remain at Slack through the end of this year.           “As a woman who has spent her career in technology, it’s a gift to lean on my experience to lead a company dedicated to women and encouraging equality, integrity and kindness, all deeply personal and inspiring to me,” Jones said in a statement about joining Bumble.

business,Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd steps down as CEO. She’ll be replaced by Slack’s leader,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/tech/bumble-whitney-wolfe-herd-steps-down-as-ceo/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is stepping down as chief executive after nearly a decade running the dating app company.           Starting on January 2, Wolfe Herd will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a longtime tech executive who has been serving since December as the CEO of the workplace communication service Slack, Bumble confirmed in a securities filing Monday. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as executive chair.           “This move to Executive Chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” Wolfe Herd said in a statement, adding that she and Jones would be “fantastic partners.”           The leadership transition was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.           Wolfe Herd started her career at rival dating service Tinder, which she co-founded. But she left in 2014 and filed a lawsuit against the company alleging sexual harassment and discrimination, which was eventually settled.           She then launched Bumble based on the idea that giving women the chance to make the first move on a dating app would empower them with more control over their romantic lives. Wolfe Herd founded Bumble with the help of Andrey Andreev, the former owner of the dating app Badoo; in 2019, she became head of the combined company after Andreev was accused of racism and sexism.           Today, Bumble is the parent company of four apps — Bumble, Official, Badoo and Fruitz — and the Bumble app has expanded to include features to help people find friends and professional connections. The company has more than 3.6 million paying users across its apps, according to its most recent earnings report.           When Bumble made its initial public offering in 2021, Wolfe Herd, then 31, became one of the world’s youngest self-made female billionaires.           But since then, the company’s share price has foundered. Bumble (BMBL) shares opened trading at $76 dollars on the day of its IPO but are now trading below $14, a more than 80% decline. The company’s stock fell an another 8% on Monday following news of Wolfe Herd’s departure from the CEO role.           Bumble is set to report earnings for the quarter ended in September on Tuesday.

business,Apple’s ‘scary fast’ upgrades hint at its vision for the AI era,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/01/tech/apple-ai-upgrades/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            During an Apple product launch the night before Halloween, Apple CEO Tim Cook – wearing all black at its Cupertino, California-based headquarters – introduced the next phase of Mac computers which hint at a more AI- driven future.           The focus of the event, which featured the tagline “scary fast,” was Apple’s new custom-made M3 chips, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Pro Max. These processors promise faster computing and graphics and longer-lasting battery life, but can also better support advancements with artificial intelligence because they’re made with 3 nanometer technology, according to the company. The chips will ship with Apple’s latest MacBook Pro and iMac lineup.           “They are the most advanced chips ever created for a personal computer,” Cook said. “This deep integration is something only Apple can deliver, and we never stop innovating.”           At a time companies such as Microsoft, Google and Meta have openly discussed their plans for an AI future, Apple has been less forthcoming. (It has, however, reportedly been working on its own generative AI tools to rival ChatGPT). Some analysts believe Apple’s vision for how it can support work in the AI field and harness the power of its new chip were evident from the Halloween event.           “Apple may not wax eloquent about AI but it knows very well that the use cases for this technology are booming and that the development work will require unprecedented computing power,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at Forrester. “That’s a huge emerging opportunity, and Apple wants a piece of that pie.”     ‘So, how hard can it be?’           During the presentation, Apple showed how researchers can conduct an analysis on an M3 device for complex tasks such as DNA/RNA sequencing, which could help detect early-stage cancers or help prevent pandemics, from anywhere in the world. It also touted a promo video that demonstrated how the Mac can be used to do anything from analyzing ECG signals to mapping the structure of the galaxies. “It’s hard work,” one actor in the video says. “But you’re on a Mac,” says another. “So how hard can it be?”           The upgrades come at a time when Apple is gaining substantial ground in the traditional PC and laptop market but still ranks fourth behind Lenovo, Dell and HP in the number of products shipped, according to IDC Research. Apple said it shipped about 26 million Macs in 2022, making up 9.1% of the overall market (up from 7.8% the year prior). At the same time, the overall PC market shipped about 292 million computers the same year, down 15% from the year before.           The iPhone and Apple services — such as iCloud, Apple TV+ and Apple Music — remain a major revenue driver for the company, but Macs and iPad sales have declined year over year, largely due to weaker demand, excess inventory and a worsening macroeconomic climate.           “Apple is looking for a revenue bump, especially going into the holidays, from the new iPhone 15, but the sense is that demand is tepid, especially out of China which is a significant market for the brand,” said Chatterjee. “If iPhone revenue slows down, something has to offset that.”     ‘Building their own sandbox’         It’s difficult, however, to predict how the new chip will impact the total sales of the computer market, according to David McQueen, a director at ABI Research. He said Apple aims to pit itself against Intel, as well as Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA and Dell, not only as a performance leader but with chips that support productivity-related AI tools.           “It is an important part of Apple’s strategy to make sure performance of its silicon can keep up with or ahead of its competitors,” McQueen said.           Meanwhile, Kieren Jessop, an analyst with UK-based market research firm Canalys, said it’s less about Apple catching up and more about “running their own race.”           “Apple’s emphasis on the ‘Pro’ user makes it clear they’re calling on developers to amplify the power of their platform … building their own sandbox for developers to build in,” he said.           Although Apple’s vision for the AI era is still not abundantly clear, the introduction of the M3 chip for its MacBook Pro and iMac lines “solidified its commitment to a future rich in AI integration,” he added.

business,Cold weather testing: Airplanes endure punishing extremes,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/plane-airbus-cold-weather-testing/index.html,"       With extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying.           The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service.           CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold.           The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut.           The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test.           All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat.            “Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,” Airbus’ head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters.            Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle.           The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing.            For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as “a premier cold-weather test site.”            Airbus has tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials.            But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places.     Four million parts, 30 countries: How an Airbus A380 comes together         In April 2010, Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner.            In a test chamber the aircraft was given a “cold soak” and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours.            Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours.            “These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a news release.             But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature.            Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus’ tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius – too warm for the cold weather testing.

business,"In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16 billion fortune evaporated",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/sbf-wealth/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News      Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.           Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”     Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy         FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.            The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.            He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.            Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.           As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.            On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

opinion,How the Biden administration can ensure mask access to all Americans,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/opinions/covid-19-masks-recommendations-ha-bukhsh/index.html," Editor’s Note: Emmeline Ha, MD is a family physician and Miriam Bukhsh, MD is an emergency physician. They are health policy fellows at the George Washington University Department of Emergency Medicine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion on CNN.         Health care workers vividly remember the anxiety surrounding mask access in the early days of the pandemic. The shortages of personal protective equipment in hospitals were so severe that it was an all-too-common occurrence to walk into work, only to find that there were no available N95 respirators in your size.            Hospitals did their best to come up with solutions to circumvent this shortage – including recommending repetitive use, performing ultraviolet light cleanings of used masks and simply rationing – but we still remember the stress of feeling physically under-protected.           Thankfully, as we enter year three of the pandemic, access to masks in the health care setting has improved. However, the Omicron variant has led to some of the highest daily case counts since the start of the pandemic and many states are utilizing greater than 70% of their inpatient and intensive care unit beds. The rapidly infectious nature of Omicron has made many public health leaders reconsider the approach to masking for the general public.           On Friday, the CDC updated its mask guidance for preventing the spread of Covid-19. The agency provided additional information about the various types of masks that are available and in which circumstances each type is appropriate. Overall, it is recommended that individuals wear masks that “fit well” and that they will “wear consistently,” with the understanding that higher quality masks like N95s and KN95s will offer more protection than a simple cloth mask if worn correctly.       What Justice Gorsuch's masklessness says about society         While higher quality masks provide better protection, multiple barriers prevent widespread public use of them. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that, when masks are required in the workplace, those masks must be approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This has led to false marketing of non-NIOSH-approved masks and prompted the CDC to publish a guide on identifying counterfeits. On Project N95, a nonprofit organization which lists vetted masks and respirators, the prices for 20 N95s range from $27-$124. In addition to quality misrepresentation and financial limitations, proper size and fitting of these masks can vary from person to person.            President Joe Biden announced Thursday that his administration would make high-quality masks widely available and free for Americans. Also last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to provide three N95 masks to every American using the United States Postal Service for distribution and additional pick-up sites at community locations. While these are promising steps for increasing mask access, we strongly urge officials to value local partnerships in their initiatives.            If vaccine rollout and the testing shortages have taught us anything, it is that we need to be proactive in ensuring equitable access to these masks. While the administration has noted that the masks will be available at some local pharmacies and community centers, it will be critical to ensure that sufficient supply is available to those who have high risk exposure to the virus.           For example, those who work outside of the home and interact with others may need more masks than those who work from home. In addition, if the method of signing up for free masks is similar to the current federal government’s free at-home Covid-19 test website that went up Tuesday, individuals with broadband access issues and limited English proficiency may be unable to navigate these services.           We, therefore, recommend the following three venues for mask distribution that will address both equitable access and effective use.      Counterfeit N95 masks are everywhere. Here's how to spot them         The first location is in established areas where people are already receiving medical care. These include the community centers and pharmacies that the administration has noted will be distribution spots, but the list should extend to primary care clinics, hospitals, medical and dental centers, Covid-19 vaccination sites and Covid-19 testing centers. By partnering with local places that the general public regularly uses and trusts with their health, effective education and prevention can be achieved. A state-based program in Maryland is already pursuing this method and will soon be distributing high-quality masks at state-run testing and vaccination sites.            The second location is the workplace. Individual companies could put in requests for masks based on their number of employees. Given that a “high-quality” mask is one that is not wet or soiled, organizations would have to assess the likelihood of mask reusability depending upon the task the employee is hired to do and request masks for more frequent changing if needed.            Especially after the recent Supreme Court ruling blocking the general workplace vaccine mandate, masks can be a line of protection for vulnerable populations while at work. In Los Angeles, employers are already required to provide well-fitting medical-grade masks to employees who work indoors in close contact with others.           The third location that would benefit from high-quality mask distribution is schools. We have argued in the past that school mask mandates play an important role in fighting the spread of this virus. For younger children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine or whose household members are immunocompromised or unvaccinated, high-quality masks may be their primary source of protection during the school day.            There are no N95 respirators designed for children and only certain KN95s and medical-grade surgical masks are made to fit children. Given the difficulties in purchasing these masks (including costs and supply availability), school partnerships would provide more equitable access. The number of masks needed could be identified through school rosters and then allocated appropriately. States like Colorado have been distributing free at-home Covid-19 testing kits through school-based programs. Similar processes to this can be used to plan for mask distribution.       Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Compared to the early days of limited personal protective equipment, we have made great strides. When the administration releases their plans for mask distribution this week, we hope they take into account the lessons learned thus far from the pandemic. By distributing high-quality masks directly to the public where they are at, we can maximize protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus – balancing equitable access and effective use for all.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,What 2020’s pro-Trump phony electors means for 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/opinions/2020-election-phony-electors-democracy-alexander/index.html," Editor’s Note: Robert Alexander is a professor of political science and founding director of the Institute for Civics and Public Policy at Ohio Northern University. He is also the author of “Representation and the Electoral College.” Follow him on Twitter: @onuprof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.         As the January 6 House select committee continues to investigate the events surrounding the insurrection, there has been great interest in what is a typically overlooked, yet important component of the election process – the presidential electors who vote in the Electoral College.           I have spent 20 years studying these little known figures, warning about the potential hijinks they could cause. Yet even I have been surprised by what has been uncovered in the wake of the 2020 election. It has become clear that then-President Donald Trump wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to use extraconstitutional powers to manipulate the tabulation of electoral votes to secure a second term despite his defeat in the election.           One component of this scheme was to send phony electors to cast ballots in closely contested states that were carried by President Joe Biden. At the time, Trump adviser Stephen Miller stated: “An alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we’re going to send those results up to Congress.”             Upon hearing Miller’s remarks, I wrote that those votes amounted to “pretend votes” and would not be counted in Congress due to the existence of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The act came into existence nearly a decade after the disputed election of 1876 – and was meant to provide a means to avoid constitutional crises where multiple elector slates from the same state are sent to be counted before Congress. Among other things, the ECA requires that if Congress receives two electoral slates, it should count the slate carrying the state’s executive’s signature as the rightful slate.            Since all the states in question in 2020 were certified as Biden electoral votes by their respective state executives, I considered those “alternative” votes to be purely performative, not intended to be substantive. I was wrong. It had not occurred to me that the Trump team could try to jettison the ECA and rely on Pence to unilaterally accept or reject which slates of electors were legitimate.            After all, that would be akin to a self-coup. Apart from the traditional vision of a coup requiring a military takeover of the government, self-coups occur when governments depart from typical norms of democracy by altering election laws, calling into question election results or seeking to suspend their constitutions in order to stay in power.            I have long been curious as to who actually participated in this plot, so I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request from National Archives. I received copies of slates of these phony electors from seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.             Given the extraconstitutional nature of the scheme, I expected that most would be Trump partisans on the political fringe. Instead, most were elected party officials, political officeholders and other key figures in state Republican politics.           The return addresses on the certificates included the Arizona Republican Party, the Georgia Republican Party, the Republican Party of New Mexico, the Nevada Republican Party. Michigan’s came from Kathy Berden, who included the title, “Chair of the Michigan Republican Electoral College.” Pennsylvania’s was sent in by Bill Bachenberg, who referred to himself as the “Chairperson, Electoral College of Pennsylvania.” Wisconsin’s simply stated, “Chairperson of the Electoral College of Wisconsin.” When asked by The Detroit News about why she chose to participate in this scheme, Berden said, “I can’t comment on anything like that. That was a long time ago.” CNN reached out to Bachenberg for comment, but has not received a response.            It is notable that at least a few high-profile would-be electors chose not to participate in the scheme – former US Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land being the most prominent among them. In total, of 84 people across seven states, 15 chose not to participate in this effort.            Still, that a majority were apparently willing to participate in such a dubious plot suggests that undemocratic efforts have been sanctioned by party regulars and will likely persist if gone unchecked.           Of course, these alternate slates weren’t without some glaring problems. The ECA stipulates that electoral votes should be certified by each state – accompanied with a signature by each state’s executive and delivered under each state’s seal. None of these alternate slates of electoral votes had a signature by a governor or a secretary of state, nor did they contain an official state seal.            The alternate Michigan electors in this scheme were turned away from entering the statehouse, which is where electors are required to assemble to cast their ballots by Michigan state law. In addition to falsely claiming they were the “duly elected” Michigan electors, the certificate that they submitted to Pence and the National Archives indicated that they signed it inside the statehouse (which they didn’t).            Much of the conversation around “alternate electors” now centers on the work of one of Trump’s lawyers, John Eastman, and his legal memo for how to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A key part of the memo had Pence introducing alternative slates of Republican electors in seven states that Trump did not win. In spite of the ECA, Eastman argued that Pence could unilaterally determine which of the two electoral slates should be counted – or potentially discard the votes from those seven states, claim that no candidate reached a majority of electoral votes and leave the selection of the president to the House of Representatives. Contrary to what he wrote in his memo, Eastman told the National Review last October that, “anybody who thinks that that’s a viable strategy is crazy.”            Ultimately, Pence did not carry out the plan offered by Eastman and championed by Trump. In handling the dueling slate of electors, he thankfully deferred to the ECA to guide his actions. Indeed, in spite of the noise created by the Big Lie about the 2020 presidential election results, every state certified its election results, courts dismissed more than 50 election-related lawsuits and federal officials found no evidence of widespread fraud, concluding that the election was the “most secure election in American history.”            However, given how far rogue electors in seven states went to undermine the election, it is clear further investigation and reforms are needed. First, the American people must learn who exactly was responsible for coordinating the effort to undo the 2020 elections. Identifying who organized the effort is a critical step toward accountability – both politically and legally. This underscores the important work of the January 6 committee.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Second, the country does not have the luxury of waiting a decade to reform the ECA. Changes can include raising the standard to object to electoral votes, which is now set at only one senator and one House member, to a majority in both houses. Clarifying and limiting the vice president’s role in the joint session is another solution that should be considered. Notably, a House committee is currently considering reform.           What’s clear is that lawmakers must act now to prevent a similar occurrence in the 2024 election. There appears to be bipartisan momentum to do so, and the legitimacy of our presidential electoral system depends on it.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

opinion,Leanza Abucayan/CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/opinions/democracy-autocracy-21st-century-fight-fredrick/index.html," Editor’s Note: In this series, “Voices of Freedom,” 13 dissidents from around the world share their stories and make the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project.         Marina Nemat was only 13 years old when the freedom that she had taken for granted – singing in public, wearing a swimsuit at the beach and holding her boyfriend’s hand – was suddenly taken away.           But what shocked Nemat the most was the speed of her nation’s descent into a theocratic regime in 1979. Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country’s previous government, itself a repressive monarchy.           When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious Evin prison, where she would spend the next two-plus years, released just shy of 19 – alive, but deeply broken. From that traumatizing time, she says she learned “those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up.”           Wai Hnin Pwint Thon was already four years old when she first met her father, Ko Mya Aye, a democratic activist who had been sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the military dictatorship in Burma (now known as Myanmar) in 1988.           Though at first she thought he was being treated well, the iron bars that prevented her from embracing her father soon jolted Wai Hnin to reality. In that moment, she says, a child became an aspiring voice for human rights, one who would speak out over the nearly three decades since that meeting – as her father was repeatedly imprisoned, most recently after the military’s February coup.            Wai Hnin, now living in exile, writes that her father’s “commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work.”             Evan Mawarire never got to experience freedom in his country. By the time he turned three, Robert Mugabe had become Zimbabwe’s prime minister – and for the next 37 years, the dictator would run the country with the full weight of the government and military behind him, claiming that “only God” could remove him from power.            In 2016, Mawarire, now a pastor, concluded that the status quo in Zimbabwe could not stand. Corruption was rampant, deflation had replaced hyperinflation, and free and fair elections were long gone.            His decision to post a video, in which he draped himself in the country’s flag while giving an impassioned lament for the current state of Zimbabwe, was a huge risk. Still, Mawarire tells CNN, he got to the point where he realized “no one else is going to fight for this country with as much passion and commitment as I am.” He was later imprisoned for his political activism and, like Nemat and Wai Hnin, now lives in exile.            Mawarire, Nemat and Wai Hnin are among the 21st century’s freedom fighters – people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, “Voices of Freedom,” 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting democratic values at home and abroad.            The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. “As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy’s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,” wrote Freedom House’s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. “Incumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists—lacking effective international support—faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.”           The organization labeled 2020 “the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom” and determined that less than 20% of the world’s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world’s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States.            On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists stormed the citadel of US democracy – the Capitol – in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power – and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office.            Five people died that day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the rioters caused an estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building.            Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found that 15% of Americans believe that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”            Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, 51% of Americans believe it’s “at least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.” When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh.            As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, “it wasn’t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government – it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.” Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States “is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world… faces a dark future.”           Compounding problems, economic forces – including growing inequality – and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance can reward citizens with improved prosperity – and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west.            However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, gave a speech claiming China had a “whole-process democracy,” a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which “prescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.”            These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, for years, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing’s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people, finds a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party’s surveillance of the Chinese people.           There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious – that China’s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies).            But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of – a growing dissatisfaction with their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden remarked, “This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies…We’ve got to prove democracy works.”            There is one feature all democracies share in common – they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that’s a system worth fighting for – even if it comes at great cost.           He writes, “Hailing from the Soviet Union… a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege – one that must constantly be defended.” Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin’s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate.           Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in.            Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so – whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest.           Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity.            For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar’s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year’s military coup.            The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country’s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began carrying out the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner – driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military has largely denied these allegations.)           Though Myanmar’s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section recognizing the “special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.” This ambiguity in the wording – combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists – has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution.           But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which – when secured – gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, economic inequality and stagnation have been driving factors of protests across the world – from Argentina to Egypt, France to India.            He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong write that this backlash is “a late-stage warning gong for capitalism,” arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the “dislocation and insecurity in the middle class” are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people – leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo, explains to CNN.           In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, was able to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor’s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win “because people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn’t have much to lose.”           Bolsonaro’s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today – that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, “makes putting a radical who…lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.”           It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people’s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN.           Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orbán to offer a different vision – one in which Hungarians could prosper.            And, according to several metrics, Orbán has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary’s official unemployment figures and government debt had fallen, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved.           Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orbán became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country’s independent institutions – including its judiciary.            More recently, his government “has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,” says a Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary is now classified as partly free – and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course.           Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn’t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our “information environment.” In the early days of the internet and social media, activists were quite adept at using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas.            One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, writes that these digital campaigns – often run across social media platforms – “exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.” The consequence is an erosion of citizens’ trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive.            One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is the United States. According to a declassified US intelligence report, Trump was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens.            And while Trump’s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans’ faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply “to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” according to the report.            Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump’s favor, tampered in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend – Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (All countries deny meddling in US elections.)             According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats – learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy.            This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans’ loss of faith in government and institutions, which had already been on the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows that only 36% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.            The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump’s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden’s victory in the minds of the American people – at in-person rallies, through sham audits, in television appearances and in public statements. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans – and a startling 78% of Republicans – now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.            At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López argued that the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship – but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States.            This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people’s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions – from schools to houses of worship to social clubs – can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad.            Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says.           Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a “comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,” but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens.            It’s no surprise, Chavez says, that low voter turnout has become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see an eight point rise in voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy – from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward.            While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump’s election lies.            Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. “The Constitution – which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to – is under attack. Trump’s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,” she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies’ dangerous assertions of power.           Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all.           In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still stayed home. According to 2020 US Census data, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos poll supports the census findings – almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to a NPR analysis of this poll, these nonvoters “are disengaged, disaffected and don’t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.”           Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters – and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives.            Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public – such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure – they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people’s day-to-day lives.            And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America’s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation’s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to “remind us of the importance of America’s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,” Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN.            In response, RDI launched the Frontlines of Freedom project. It features an open letter, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, “If the world’s leading democracy doesn’t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.”            Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat “illiberalism with illiberalism,” but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated.            As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy.            For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov write that for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it “will require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.” The United States could take lead on this by “providing material and ideological support to the country’s pro-democracy elements.”            This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, “people-to-people aid” can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich’s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country’s democratic slogans has become, “If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.”           And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, “I’m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I’m doing it myself.”           Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but “there’s going to be a generation that’s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,” he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth.

Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. “As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy’s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,” wrote Freedom House’s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. “Incumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists—lacking effective international support—faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.”           The organization labeled 2020 “the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom” and determined that less than 20% of the world’s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world’s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States.            On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists stormed the citadel of US democracy – the Capitol – in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power – and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office.            Five people died that day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the rioters caused an estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building.            Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found that 15% of Americans believe that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”            Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, 51% of Americans believe it’s “at least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.” When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh.            As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, “it wasn’t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government – it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.” Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States “is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world… faces a dark future.”           Compounding problems, economic forces – including growing inequality – and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance can reward citizens with improved prosperity – and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west.            However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, gave a speech claiming China had a “whole-process democracy,” a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which “prescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.”            These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, for years, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing’s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people, finds a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party’s surveillance of the Chinese people.           There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious – that China’s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies).            But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of – a growing dissatisfaction with their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden remarked, “This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies…We’ve got to prove democracy works.”            There is one feature all democracies share in common – they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that’s a system worth fighting for – even if it comes at great cost.           He writes, “Hailing from the Soviet Union… a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege – one that must constantly be defended.” Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin’s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate.           Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in.            Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so – whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest.           Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity.            For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar’s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year’s military coup.            The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country’s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began carrying out the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner – driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military has largely denied these allegations.)           Though Myanmar’s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section recognizing the “special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.” This ambiguity in the wording – combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists – has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution.           But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which – when secured – gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, economic inequality and stagnation have been driving factors of protests across the world – from Argentina to Egypt, France to India.            He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong write that this backlash is “a late-stage warning gong for capitalism,” arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the “dislocation and insecurity in the middle class” are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people – leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo, explains to CNN.           In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, was able to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor’s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win “because people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn’t have much to lose.”           Bolsonaro’s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today – that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, “makes putting a radical who…lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.”           It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people’s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN.           Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orbán to offer a different vision – one in which Hungarians could prosper.            And, according to several metrics, Orbán has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary’s official unemployment figures and government debt had fallen, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved.           Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orbán became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country’s independent institutions – including its judiciary.            More recently, his government “has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,” says a Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary is now classified as partly free – and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course.           Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn’t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our “information environment.” In the early days of the internet and social media, activists were quite adept at using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas.            One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, writes that these digital campaigns – often run across social media platforms – “exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.” The consequence is an erosion of citizens’ trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive.            One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is the United States. According to a declassified US intelligence report, Trump was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens.            And while Trump’s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans’ faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply “to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” according to the report.            Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump’s favor, tampered in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend – Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (All countries deny meddling in US elections.)             According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats – learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy.            This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans’ loss of faith in government and institutions, which had already been on the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows that only 36% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.            The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump’s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden’s victory in the minds of the American people – at in-person rallies, through sham audits, in television appearances and in public statements. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans – and a startling 78% of Republicans – now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.            At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López argued that the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship – but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States.            This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people’s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions – from schools to houses of worship to social clubs – can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad.            Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says.           Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a “comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,” but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens.            It’s no surprise, Chavez says, that low voter turnout has become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see an eight point rise in voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy – from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward.            While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump’s election lies.            Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. “The Constitution – which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to – is under attack. Trump’s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,” she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies’ dangerous assertions of power.           Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all.           In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still stayed home. According to 2020 US Census data, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos poll supports the census findings – almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to a NPR analysis of this poll, these nonvoters “are disengaged, disaffected and don’t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.”           Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters – and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives.            Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public – such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure – they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people’s day-to-day lives.            And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America’s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation’s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to “remind us of the importance of America’s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,” Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN.            In response, RDI launched the Frontlines of Freedom project. It features an open letter, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, “If the world’s leading democracy doesn’t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.”            Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat “illiberalism with illiberalism,” but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated.            As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy.            For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov write that for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it “will require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.” The United States could take lead on this by “providing material and ideological support to the country’s pro-democracy elements.”            This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, “people-to-people aid” can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich’s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country’s democratic slogans has become, “If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.”           And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, “I’m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I’m doing it myself.”           Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but “there’s going to be a generation that’s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,” he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth.

She has been advocating for human rights and federal democracy in Burma, now widely known as Myanmar, for over a decade. Wai Hnin is also a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.         I was 4 years old when my mom took me to meet my dad for the first time. I thought we were traveling to a park or a playground, but then we arrived outside Insein prison in Rangoon (present day Yangon), Burma, and I was even more impressed. It was a massive compound with an imposing red entrance and more guards than I could count.            “Is daddy very wealthy?,” I asked. My mom told me to keep quiet and stay close to her. Men in uniform drilled her with questions, while other guards rummaged through the gifts that we had brought for my dad.            After waiting for hours in the scorching sun, we were finally allowed into a room where we met a man dressed in all white, and in handcuffs and shackles. I recognized him instantly – this was my father whose photo had hung on a glass cabinet in my house for as far back as I could remember. His wild hair from the photo wasn’t so wild anymore, but he still had that friendly smile on his face. I wanted to hug him, even though there were iron bars between us. I reached out my fingers so I could at least touch his hand.            Although this first meeting happened almost three decades ago, I can so clearly remember it. That was the day I realized that my dad was a prisoner being kept by these guards. And those “gifts” that we brought for him? They were essential food and medicine, which he needed to stay alive behind these foreboding concrete walls.           My father was first sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the Burmese military dictatorship in 1988. He was among thousands of students who marched on the street calling for democracy, human rights and freedom in my country. Since then, he has been in and out of prison for continuing to protest military rule and advocating for human rights.             But his commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work, and it could come with serious consequences – not just for my family or country but for the world at large.           Following my first meeting with my father, I began to study the history of Burma. I learned that it had been under an oppressive military dictatorship since 1962. I also read how the military ruthlessly killed many peaceful protesters during the 1988 uprising and how they imprisoned thousands of civilians for simply believing in democracy and freedom. Though military regimes have come and gone since then, the military today – though it denies its brutality – continues to commit atrocities with impunity, according to the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights.            The more I learned, the more certain I was that I needed to follow in my father’s footsteps. Though my father urged me to choose a different path, I refused to heed his warnings.            I thought I might pursue teaching, since I believed education could play a crucial role in driving social change and empowering young people to fight for their rights. But because of my father’s political activities, I was denied entrance into any Burmese university. And so, in 2007, I arrived in the United Kingdom to study international relations. That same year, my father was arrested a second time for leading another peaceful protest. Even though I was thousands of miles away, I started campaigning for the release of all political prisoners in Burma – including my father.      Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me         But what I had not fully anticipated was the consequence I would face from the Burmese government. Having used my voice abroad, I could no longer return home without facing the possibility of arrest. I subsequently became a political dissident in exile.             In 2008, caving to a combination of internal and external pressures, the Burmese military regime drafted a new constitution, which while safeguarding much of their power, offered limited democratic and social reforms. Two years later, they released Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition leader who had spent nearly 15 years in detention, and allowed her to stand for elections in April 2012.           For the United States and much of the international community, Suu Kyi’s freedom – and her party’s sweeping electoral victory in 2015 – marked a significant milestone in my country’s journey toward democracy. But it did not fully capture the subtle and not so subtle ways that the military continued to hold a tight grip on Burma.           While the new constitution and Suu Kyi’s government provided a wider space for civil society – and greater access to tools like social media and the internet – the military still had guaranteed ministerial posts and appointed a quarter of MPs in the parliament. And while many of these social reforms were enacted in cities, the military was continuing to torture, rape and kill ethnic civilians in more rural areas, according to an independent report requested by the UN Human Rights Council.       What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell         Despite warnings from human rights activists like me that the reform process in Burma was designed to keep the military in power, the international community largely ignored our concerns. Meanwhile, many activists in Burma who spoke out against the military and demanded genuine democracy were arrested and thrown in prison.            In late 2016, when the military began perpetrating what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, it seemed like things might be reaching a breaking point.            Finally, we thought, the international community would wake up to the atrocities being committed in Burma and come to our aid. Except this aid largely took the form of sanctioning a few Burmese military generals, freezing their assets and banning them from traveling to the US.            It’s no wonder Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the Burmese military, calculated that he could get away with staging a coup in February. The same day the coup began and Suu Kyi was arrested on trumped up charges, the military came for my father, who had most recently been released from prison in 2012. As a prominent democracy advocate, the military undoubtedly considered my father a troublemaker, and they arrested him before he could mobilize any anti-coup movement.      Our deepest fear for America -- and the world         But it wasn’t just him. Many others were taken from their homes across Burma to prisons they may never leave. I am heartbroken for my father, but I cannot stop thinking about the other children now condemned to go through what I went through – not knowing where their parents are or when they will see them again.            I am encouraged to see that when the coup began, the US government took immediate action against the Burmese military by imposing targeted sanctions. But we need more. The US and the greater international community need to use all the tools at their disposal – diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and legal – to help people in Burma.            Activists inside and outside the country have been calling for a global arms embargo to stop the flow of weapons to the military, additional sanctions on gas revenues that help fund the Burmese military, and support for efforts to report the military’s violent actions to the International Criminal Court.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Though I do not know when my father will be released from prison this time, or when I will be able to go home safely, I will continue to speak out against the military and amplify the voices of people in Burma who have been oppressed by the brutal military regime. Yes, the Burmese military denies this oppression and says it’s part of its fight against terrorism, but the truth is that we are being persecuted.           Despite the ongoing use of violence, I refuse to believe the Burmese military has won. People like my father and many others like him continue to risk our lives for the sake of freedom. And with the aid of the US and the rest of the free world, we might just have a chance to help the people of Burma achieve true democracy.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

I was 13 years old when the Islamic Revolution toppled the Iranian government in 1979. Though I was a Christian living in a largely Muslim country, I had never felt discrimination because of my faith.           My grandmothers had escaped the 1917 Russian Revolution and fled to Iran in search of freedom. And to a certain extent, they had found it. My father had become a successful ballroom dancing instructor in Tehran and taught Muslim couples the cha-cha and the tango. My mother was a hairdresser who styled fashionable Muslim women’s hair. And I had grown up wearing bikinis on the shores of the Caspian Sea, while partying with my Muslim friends.            The revolutionary leaders promised to expand social freedoms, grant political ones and build a democracy. They used our grievances against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to win our trust and gain power. But as soon as they assumed office, the few personal liberties we had enjoyed vanished and a strict Islamic law was put in place.            In less than a year, women’s rights to self-expression were stripped away: dancing, singing, holding our boyfriends’ hands in public and wearing bikinis all became largely forbidden activities. A few priests from my Roman Catholic Church, all of whom were foreign nationals who had lived in Iran for years, were deported, and several of the properties that belonged to the church were confiscated.      I was born in a Chinese 'reeducation camp.' I'm watching history repeat itself         The irony was that a few of my Christian relatives had trusted Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic revolutionary leader, and celebrated when the Shah was forced into exile. Now, they, like me, were paying the price.           Though Iran’s transition from a nation of limited social rights to one of virtually none may seem like a distant reality to those living under democracy, the truth is that it is not.           If Western democracies are not on guard, their citizens can fall prey to the same kinds of leaders who now control Iran’s political infrastructure. The revolutionary leaders were populists who promised to return power to the people after decades of monarchical rule, and for many disenfranchised voters in democracies who feel their elected officials have ignored their struggles, the populist messaging can have quite a strong appeal – even if it is just a ploy.            But the risk is not only in losing civil or democratic rights, but in being punished for challenging the authority figures who have stripped citizens of those rights.            After 1979, our accomplished teachers were replaced by fanatical young academics, many of whom were members of the newly formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They spent class time spreading the government’s propaganda and trying to persuade us that the regime’s fanatical rules – like forcing all women and girls over age 9 to wear the hijab – were for our own good. They argued that we had to dress modestly so that we would not attract unwanted attention from men.            At the time, I told our principal that I was a Christian, so the new Islamic rules of modesty should not apply to me. She responded, “You believe in the wrong religion.” I was politically naïve, but I was also aggrieved, having experienced firsthand why freedom of religion mattered. I attended protest rallies to express my frustration with the new religious laws that limited or attacked the rights of Iranian women.           Speaking out against the regime, in any shape or form, was now considered an act of war against God – the penalty for which could be death. And, in January 1982, the Revolutionary Guard arrested me for doing just that. At only 16, I had been accused of being an anti-revolutionary and sent to the notorious Evin prison. I was tortured, physically and emotionally, and then I was forced to marry one of my interrogators, who was assassinated 15 months after the marriage.      The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracy         Six months after his death – and two years, two months and 12 days after my initial arrest – I was released. My captors had decided that there was no reason to keep me any longer, perhaps because they had succeeded in destroying my spirit and suppressing my desire to protest. Many of my friends and cellmates had been executed while I was in prison, and I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – not that I knew it at the time. I was just shy of 19 years of age when I was released.           Though it took me several years – and a move to Canada – before I shared the details of my tragic story, I determined to do so because a democracy is only as good as its citizens. Now, living in the West, I have become acutely aware that even the strongest democracies are not immune to demagogues parading as populists. Those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up. Because once the demagogues – or aspiring ones –  have assumed control, it will be too late.           Indeed, democracy is like water caught in the palm of our hands. If we do not focus on holding onto it, the water will drip away through our fingers, and we will be left with nothing but a burning thirst.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Though Iran was not a democracy before the revolution, any hope of a peaceful transition to one post-revolution has all but faded today. The Islamic Republic of Iran masquerades as a democracy, holding elections for its parliament and president. Yet, its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who replaced Ayatollah Khomeini after his death, and his Guardian Council decide who is or is not fit to run in elections.            And it certainly does not have a thriving free press or civil society. Anyone who criticizes the regime and its officials can be arrested and even condemned to death.            The line that separates democracy from tyranny is not as thick as Westerners might choose to believe. In Iran, we believed that our good will, selfless efforts and desire for better governance could not possibly be manipulated and destroyed. Many of us even died during the revolution to bring the Islamic Republic into existence. But we were wrong, and we have been paying the price for close to half a century.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

opinion,What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/11/opinions/venezuela-democracy-loss-freedom-lesson-lopez/index.html," Editor’s Note: Leopoldo López is a Venezuelan politician and opposition leader who was imprisoned on charges of inciting anti-government protests. He is a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.         For many people, freedom is an abstract concept. It’s like breathing; you don’t think about it until you are gasping for air.           The same thing happens with democracy. Too many voters take it for granted, until the moment they realize it’s entirely possible to have an election without democracy – just like in Cuba, Russia, Iran, and my home country of Venezuela.           This became painfully clear to me while I was imprisoned for political opposition to President Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship. In a 2x2 meter cell with a lock the size of a brick, I learned what freedom was when I didn’t have it.           The Venezuela I was born into in the 1970s was considered the envy of the Americas: a country with a strong economy capable of providing prosperity and opportunities to almost everybody. Venezuelan leaders had successfully built this regime of freedom after the downfall of Marcos Pérez Jiménez’s military dictatorship in 1958. Between the 1960s and 1990s, Venezuela was “the democratic exception” in Latin America, a title that every Venezuelan carried with pride.           My country had some of the best public services of the region during that time – including a prestigious network of schools and universities and a health care system that helped eradicate malaria in parts of the country in 1961, as certified by the World Health Organization (WHO), a status Venezuela has since lost. This was an era when many Europeans and Latin Americans alike wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for a better life.     The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracy         Now, 22 years after Hugo Chávez’s presidency began and nearly a decade after Maduro seized power in what I believe was a fraudulent 2013 presidential election, Venezuela is undergoing the worst multilayered crisis in the continent. Poverty, violence, starvation, and shortages of crucial supplies are the new normal. A 2016 survey found that almost three-quarters of the population involuntarily lost an average of 19 pounds, with emergency rooms overwhelmed by cases of severely malnourished children.            Hospitals lack the equipment and medicine they need to function, leaving families across the country at risk of dying without access to treatment – a situation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 6 million Venezuelans have fled the country, many for fear of persecution or lack of economic opportunities.            How did we turn from being an island of democracy to a broken dictatorship? I think the answer is twofold: First, we suffered an erosion of the essential elements of democracy. After becoming president in 1999, within a year, Chávez changed the national constitution and called for a “mega-election” that saw him inaugurated for a six-year term. He changed the political structure of the country; packed the Supreme Court; took control over the National Electoral Council; and labeled critical members of the free press as “enemies of the homeland.”     Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me         Second, this democratic erosion was met with an immoral neutrality from democracies around the world. When we the Venezuelans were losing our freedoms, too many people in the region believed that our problem was not also their own. I witnessed this tragedy from my position as a local politician.            After studying abroad in the US in the early 1990s, I returned to Venezuela and ran for public office in 2000. I was elected and reelected as mayor of Chacao, a powerful municipality in Caracas that is home to almost 80,000 people. For eight years, we proved that it was possible to serve democratically in a country being led in the opposite direction.            That changed in 2008, when I was disqualified from running for governor of Caracas city, despite two consecutive successful terms as mayor of Chacao and over 70% popular support. Under Chávez, the National Comptroller banned my participation in any electoral process on charges of corruption and financial impropriety – a ban that went into effect before I was even formally charged with these false accusations. With no place to look for justice within my country, I took my case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and I won. In response, Chávez’s regime formally withdrew Venezuela from the inter-American system and, naturally, dismissed the ruling in my favor.            Unable to serve, I visited towns and cities across the country, from the Colombian border to the Atlantic coast. I wanted to prove that it wasn’t necessary to be an elected authority to serve our people. What I saw on that journey were Venezuelans who were more than ready to fight for freedom and democracy. That experience led me, along with other democratic leaders, to establish the political party Voluntad Popular, a national movement steeped in grassroots activism.           When Chávez’s successor, Maduro, rose to power in 2013, I asked our movement, “Are we living in a democracy, or a dictatorship?” We agreed on the latter. Inspired by nonviolent resistance from around the world, including the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring, and US civil rights movements, we chose to peacefully protest Maduro’s regime.            The Venezuelan government’s response to our demonstrations was ruthless, and strikingly similar to what we have seen reported from the streets of countries around the world, from Belarus to Nicaragua: police brutality against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests and torture of opposition leaders, protesters sent into exile and some killed, as the UN has documented.            In February 2014, Maduro ordered my arrest and that of other Voluntad Popular members. Despite international criticism that I was arbitrarily detained, I was prosecuted and sentenced to nearly 14 years after a trial controlled by the dictatorship – proceedings the UN criticized for lack of transparency and violation of due process. I spent more than three years in a military prison, where I endured physical and psychological torture. When my wife and other supporters shared what was happening to me, Maduro’s government denied the abuse.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Many ask why Maduro is still in power, despite massive and ongoing protests. The truth is that he’s in power because he’s a dictator, and his regime’s response has been the same as others: repression and incarceration, the dictator’s recipe to hold on to power.            Perhaps we need to understand that authoritarianism is a global phenomenon. Dictators, in fact, understand this very well. They form political allegiances to protect each other internationally and have developed a transnational repression policy in order to persecute those who oppose them. This is a global problem, and its solution should be global as well.           To achieve democratic change in Venezuela, we must be part of a larger, globally organized effort. This idea is what convinced me to risk my life to escape from my country last year to resettle in Spain: A desire to be part of an international front that would help not only the people of Venezuela, but all those who live under authoritarian regimes.     © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,I was born in a Chinese ‘reeducation camp.’ I’m watching history repeat itself,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/opinions/uyghur-human-rights-history-repeat-itself-turkel/index.html," Editor’s Note: Nury Turkel is a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, vice chair at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         I was born in a Chinese reeducation camp, where my mother was detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which many Uyghurs call East Turkistan. For most of my life, I tried to forget the horrific experiences my mother and I had during my early childhood. But it seems the past is repeating itself – and with a vengeance.           When I was born, the Uyghur region – like the rest of China – was in the throes of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. It was a period of totalitarian zeal: Almost anyone suspected of not being adequately communist was beaten, jailed or killed. Religious and ethnic minorities were particular targets.            Mao’s zealots, called the Red Guards, came to the traditional Uyghur homeland to enforce the brutal policies of the tyrannical regime. The Red Guards burned religious texts, destroyed mosques, banned Uyghur-language books and ordered millions of Uyghurs – including my mother – into reeducation camps to be indoctrinated in Maoist doctrines and to be “reformed” through hard labor.            While arbitrary reeducation on a large scale experienced a lull following the end of the Cultural Revolution, forced labor programs have remained a human rights concern in China in spite of the economic reforms of the following decades.            Now, some half a century later, China is targeting the Uyghur population with a new fervor.  According to the US Department of Defense, China has detained possibly as many as 3 million Uyghurs in detention camps. Meanwhile, based on satellite imagery, CNN reports China has been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries. And, according to the accounts of several Uyghur women, it is incorporating an extensive forced sterilization program.      Our generation will either renew democracy -- or lose it forever         Having experienced the reality of living under this regime, and now watching with horror as these atrocities are visited on my Uyghur brothers and sisters, it’s difficult for me to comprehend how any Western actor could push for greater dialogue or engagement with such a regime.             How cheap are the lives of my people to the international community if it ignores reports of the Chinese government’s attempt to commit genocide against the Uyghurs? Democracies and nongovernmental organizations alike must do significantly more to support the Uyghur struggle – even if it comes with an inevitable backlash from the Chinese government.           Since leaving China in 1995 to seek political freedom and pursue graduate education, I have made it my mission to speak out against the horrors perpetrated against the Uyghurs, despite the serious consequences I have had to pay. I have not seen my mother or father for more than 17 years. The Chinese authorities have prevented my ailing and aging parents from leaving to reunite with their American children and grandchildren. Though my parents have never been given a clear reason for this, I strongly believe it is because of my criticism of the Chinese government.            As a lawyer, human rights advocate, and now vice chair for the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), I have advocated for human rights and religious freedom in China and around the world for many years. And, in these capacities, I have seen real progress in raising awareness of the atrocities perpetrated in the Uyghur region. But to have any meaningful impact, the world’s leading democracies must pursue a bolder strategy aimed squarely at hitting China where it hurts – weaponizing import bans and strategic investments.           Appallingly, many of the products enjoyed by Western countries are made by interned Uyghurs in China. According to several reports, Uyghur forced labor contributes significantly to the world economy – particularly solar-panel manufacturing and cotton-growing industries. In a liberal international order, there can be no room for forced labor.            The US Senate has taken serious steps forward on this issue by passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which establishes broad import bans on products from the Uyghur region. The US House of Representatives, which passed an earlier version of the bill in 2020, must now move quickly to pass this bill, so that President Joe Biden can sign it into law.           Our European partners – another enormous market for Chinese products – must follow suit, and the United States should encourage our allies to join us in rooting out this evil practice. While the European Union is currently crafting due diligence protocol to address human rights violations within EU supply chains, it has not given a strong enough indication that it will adopt broad import bans for products produced by Uyghur forced labor.            Europe endured the worst of the horrors of Nazism, fascism and communism – and should understand the consequences of failing to act in the face of a regime that seeks to eradicate minority groups. If the EU is to have any credibility as a moral leader, it must ban the import of products from Xinjiang.           Indeed, such bans, which go further than many of the existing sanctions already in place, can go a long way toward mitigating the atrocious crimes that Beijing is committing in the Uyghur homeland. Consider some of the US sanctions, which are already proving to be effective at chipping away at two things the Chinese party leadership cares most about – economic interests and public image.      Chinese whistleblower exposes torture of Uyghur prisoners in CNN interview         Banning the import of agricultural products – such as cotton and tomatoes – has fractured the supply chains for the fashion and food industries. And the enforcement measures behind these sanctions have also created pressure points for US companies, forcing them to recognize the risks of doing business in China while also facing administrative, legal and reputational risks in the United States. In addition, public naming and shaming through the use of sanctions has sent a powerful message to Beijing that perpetrators of human rights abuses cannot remain anonymous.            That’s not to say that this is a risk-free proposition for the countries implementing such a ban. Italy is one of the leading global importers of goods from Xinjiang, and it may be challenging for such a country to cut itself off from Xinjiang products, even if it would like to. That’s why it’s critical for powerful economies like the United States and other democracies to invest in viable alternatives to China’s forced-labor products, thereby making it easier for countries to diversify their supply chains.           This June, the US Senate passed the US Innovation and Competition Act, which designates $250 billion to boost American scientific research, design and semiconductor manufacturing. The United States and its democratic partners should consider similar legislation to boost the manufacturing of products that have until now been dominated by companies operating with forced labor in Xinjiang.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Both Donald Trump’s and Joe Biden’s administrations have labeled China’s actions toward the Uyghurs as a genocide, and the Canadian, British, Dutch and Lithuanian Parliaments have concurred. State signatories to the United Nations Genocide Convention are obliged to take action to halt genocide when it occurs and punish the perpetrators. Yet so much more remains to be done to address the continuing horrors of Xinjiang.           This cuts to the legal and moral core of the liberal international order. The dual strategy of import bans and domestic investment may not be a panacea, but it is undoubtedly a meaningful step in the right direction. After watching a lifetime of abuse by the Chinese regime, such actions give me at least a glimmer of hope that Uyghur lives mean more to the international community than platitudes.     Editor’s Note: The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any allegations of crimes – including forced labor and forced sterilization – against the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples. It claims it is providing the Uyghurs with education at “vocational training centers” while assisting in deradicalization efforts to combat alleged terrorism.   © 2023 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina – now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.      Gerrymandering – the dark art of drawing political maps to favor one party and disadvantage the other, which can be traced back to the earliest days of the nation – fundamentally altered the nature of political representation in the largest city in western North Carolina.            Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.           And, a decade ago, North Carolina’s 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation’s most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.            This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress, including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages.           Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.      North Carolina court steps up to defend democracy         But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.            Enter Mark Meadows, who won the 2012 GOP primary here with a vow to “send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is.” He’s held the seat since. Once arriving in Washington, Meadows ousted then-GOP Speaker John Boehner with a parliamentary maneuver, and became the architect of the 2013 government shutdown, as well as multiple Obamacare repeal efforts. And he’s now one of President Donald Trump’s most ardent defenders against impeachment.            Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. “The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March. The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.           Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.           And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy – and many politicians – beyond the reach of the ballot box.            But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.           Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.     Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)     What's pulling America apart?         Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start. The bad news for democracy is that we’re better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers, sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data – alongside growing polarization – make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.           It’s more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.           Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party’s 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.           In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP’s modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.)            But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.            Congress, meanwhile, has an approval rating in the upper teens, yet upward of 95% of incumbents coast to re-election. No wonder Americans feel frustrated.             It doesn’t have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado, Ohio and Utah.            Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We’ve done this to ourselves – but we can undo it, too.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,Van Jones: We got together on this issue. It could point the way for more,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/opinions/criminal-justice-reform-bipartisanship-jones/index.html," Editor’s Note: Van Jones is CEO of REFORM Alliance and co-founder of #cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. He is also the author of “Beyond the Messy Truth: How We Came Apart, How We Come Together.” In 2009, Jones worked as the Green Jobs Adviser in the Obama White House. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.         In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.           For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform – including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump. It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with “lock ‘em up” policies and “tough-on-crime” rhetoric.           This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton, who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis’ prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.           So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated – and surprising.           I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian “super jail for youth” near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps’ #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year’s federal First Step Act. This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance, which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems.            I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 – a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.           Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let’s explore the top five:      1. The trifecta         We are benefiting from an extraordinary trifecta: low crime rates, a strong economy and both parties being fed up with our bloated, ineffective prison system.     10 reasons to celebrate the First Step Act         Politicians can more easily embrace reform when job numbers are up. President Barack Obama helped put the US economy into recovery and, under Trump, unemployment has continued to decline. Now, there are more open jobs in some cities than there are qualified workers. And yet, too many job categories still exclude people with criminal records. But, in this economy, more employers are willing to hire formerly incarcerated people, and more lawmakers are willing to invest in job training, “second chance” and “clean slate” bills to help the formerly incarcerated start new lives.           Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes – like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts – veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts – across the country.     2. Culture shift         The television series, “Orange is the New Black,” brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay’s explosive documentary, “The 13th,” and Netflix series, “When They See Us,” broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from “Time: The Kalief Browder Story” to “Serial,” opened the public’s eyes.      Ava DuVernay's compelling look at tragic injustice of Central Park Five case         Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor’s bestselling book, “Writing My Wrongs,” won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.           This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.     3. Democratic value: Justice         Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton’s disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party’s platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016.           So, what changed? Many things – from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis.           Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.     Klobuchar: On criminal justice reform, it's time for a second step         Their grass-roots protests also gave Obama a greater impetus and opportunity to champion criminal justice reform. He took full advantage – granting clemency to close to 2,000 inmates, pushing hard for bipartisan legislation and even becoming the first-ever sitting US president to visit a prison. His attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, reshaped the Department of Justice – with a focus on incarcerating fewer people. And, in 2016, Hillary Clinton’s platform included a plank calling for criminal justice reform – an issue no nominee had touched for decades.           Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.           But Democrats also know the Republicans aren’t going to “Willie Horton” them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.       4. Republican value: Liberty         Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can’t believe that Republicans would truly care about a “racial justice” issue. But the truth is that Republicans have their own reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.           Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the “tough on crime” system made many communities less safe. Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They’ve returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.           One such principle is the need for fiscal prudence with taxpayer dollars and less government waste. Fiscal conservatives balk at the $80 billion annual price tag of mass incarceration. That’s one reason Republican governors, like Rick Perry in Texas and Nathan Deal in Georgia, passed reform bills that saved millions of dollars and (in Texas) even closed several prisons, all while bringing the crime rate down.       Koch network: We're rejecting partisanship in favor of problem solving         Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don’t want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.           Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform.           Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.           In theory, of course, all conservatives should oppose a big, failed government bureaucracy that produces bad outcomes while eating up taxpayer dollars. America’s massive prison industry today represents a classic case of this phenomenon. And more and more Republicans – from Right on Crime to Faith & Freedom Coalition to The American Conservative Union Foundation – are willing to say so.     5. The Trump factor         Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump’s decision to release Alice Johnson.  The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family’s arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as “tough on crime” to expressing that he’s tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Because many red state governors took the lead, this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump’s inner circle – including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner – were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.           People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause – and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump’s decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That’s a good thing for both parties – and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.           I’ve spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.            The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities – but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities – but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That’s why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship – centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.           However, here is what I know: Change is possible – and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of “bipartisan criminal justice reform” was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.            When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.           Criminal justice reform is renewing the right’s dedication to individual “liberty” and deepening the left’s commitment to social “justice.” As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with “liberty” and “justice” for all.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,Conservative: She was not a faceless liberal,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/opinions/living-room-conversation-republican-perspective-song/index.html," Editor’s Note: Julia Song is a Brazilian-American political activist and commentator, who has been featured on OANN, Rebel Media and elsewhere. Follow her on Twitter @realjuliasong. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.         I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time – way back in 2013 – Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country’s politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.            But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country’s already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison, and the country’s president – Dilma Rousseff – was impeached.             Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.           Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect – and the growing power of the political elite – I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.            I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms – and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven’t guessed yet, I’m a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump’s emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.      Voting for Trump cost me my friends         It was this reemergence in politics – and the divisive rhetoric that often animates it – that motivated me to partake in a Living Room Conversation’s session on immigration. I did so at the invitation of Sue Googe, a fellow Republican and former candidate for North Carolina’s 4th District.            Seeing how politically divided America had become – and fearful of its resemblance to parts of Brazil – I knew I had been given a rare opportunity. While Sue and I took a conservative approach to immigration, emphasizing the need to preserve our American values and rule of law, three Democrats argued a more liberal position. One, in particular, stood out to me – Rremida Shkoza, an Albanian refugee to the United States.           Rremida, like Sue, had grown up under a communist regime. While Rremida’s family fled Albania, Sue had fled China – but both shared a deep fear and suspicion of communist rule. I, who had experienced Brazilian socialism – which bore eerie similarities to communism with its emphasis on dangerously large government – was also skeptical, having experienced a government descent into corruption.     Tribalism isn't the real reason America is divided         But while Sue and I felt that Democratic socialism – and its liberalism on open borders and expanded government – was a threat to American democracy, Rremida seemed to think it was the solution to many of our problems. Having fled a dictatorship, Rremida felt that the United States had an obligation to keep its doors open to any and all asylum seekers. And while she acknowledged all people entering the United States should be vetted, she believed the government, in an expanded form, could accommodate those in need of refuge and freedom.           While I disagreed with her approach, I, too, see the humanitarian issue with refugees seeking asylum. And I lamented the fact that Republicans, while feeling for refugees, fail to clearly express that sentiment publicly.            But, unlike Rremida, I know the cost of illegal immigration on the system. As I attempt to navigate the legal system with my family, I bear the heavy weight of having to divide precious resources with immigrants who did not come here through legal means. In Brazil, my mother and brother both depend on each other for income, and while I would love to bring them here to escape the violence, it is almost impossible to bring one without the other. But to bring them here together – following all federal guidelines – could take years, as American courts battle growing immigration backlogs.             This is why I told Rremida and her fellow Democrats that the solution to immigration begins by improving the legal system – and channeling the necessary resources to continue to bring the brightest minds across the globe to the US. But it also means cracking down on illegal immigration, building a wall if needed, to dissuade people from coming via that route and jamming up the judicial system with their immigration claims.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Rremida, though not entirely agreeing, seemed to understand how my family’s experience was impacting my view of the system. While she may not have endorsed building a wall, she agreed that the distribution of resources on immigration was problematic.            Still, despite our differences, I felt she and I shared a common set of values – compassion, patriotism and a belief that our shared country could be a better version of itself. We may disagree on how to accomplish this – through a border wall or increased refugee intake, for example – and we may even disagree on the priorities of the federal government, but we agreed that illegal immigration is a challenge, and comprehensive immigration reform is vital to solving that problem.             To know a Democrat also cares about the issue of immigration, but may have a different approach to reforming the system, helps me make peace with our policy differences. Instead of being a faceless liberal, Rremida is now a fellow American with a unique set of experiences that color the way she sees the world – and the role she thinks America should play in it. And our ability to meet in the same living room, to get out of our red vs. blue silos, gives me a tremendous amount of hope.           Among the biggest takeaways, I learned that much of the ground work for bridging political divides starts in homes across America. It starts at the community level, where Americans who are already united by ties to a specific place can come together and hash out their differences.     © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

opinion,SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/opinions/third-party-need-united-states-cupp/index.html," Editor’s Note: SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of “SE Cupp Unfiltered.” The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.         In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.           This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.            And a third party that makes it its raison d’etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.           Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up – and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we’re usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren’t good enough.           Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders –that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.     Nine of 10 hands shot up.            As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.           Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted: “Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it’s time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.”     Trump is doing all the wrong things on immigration         What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters – or who had read recent polls – was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.            According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.           But this was a Democratic primary – the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?           No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn’t. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.           Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.            What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?           This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.           On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.           Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in “the Squad” – Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley – get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.            A so-called “alterna-squad,” a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”     The mythical independent voter isn't going to save us         Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I’ve heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, “Well I can’t vote for Trump, but I’m not with those guys, either.”           In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that “finding common ground” is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence “a decent guy.”)           Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most “divisive.”           Take abortion. “[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,” according to Pew. Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us – the majority – agree it should be legal but with restrictions.           Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.            A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn’t those voters feel betrayed by that?           Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties’ willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.           While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don’t, what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.     Americans exaggerate the extremism of the other side         Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally – a path to legal status – if they meet some requirements over time.           And as it turns out, that’s what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we’re to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.            So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?           Here’s the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn’t as politically profitable as keeping them broken.            Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.           Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.     Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems         As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to “own the Libs,” and Democratic voters are happy being “the resistance,” it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.           Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.           Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.           All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That’s likely only going to get worse.           A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn’t be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn’t take this position or that one, and it wouldn’t have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.           For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican – a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew, a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.            That third party would also lean pro-abortion – keeping Roe v. Wade in place – but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.           It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn’t, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.           In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn’t on either extreme. There wouldn’t be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn’t have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.            One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can’t, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.           Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.            There’s also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.            So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.           Finally, whether an alternative party in today’s age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn’t swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn’t designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one’s blood pressure almost instantly.           Because let’s face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America’s future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we’ll all be politically homeless eventually.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

opinion,John Avlon: Confronting the cult of partisan media,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/opinions/partisan-media-confronting-political-division-avlon/index.html," Editor’s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.         America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach – including the Oval Office.           President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points, often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.            We’ve always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.           What we’re dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.           The rise of social media has balkanized us further, amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.           The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That’s a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.            This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.            That doesn’t mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.           America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue’s disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media, equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker – while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy’s tactics.             McCarthy’s rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying, “We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. … We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.”           But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of “public interest” programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines – but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.           This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.            One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book “The Political Spectrum,” found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.     Polarization is poisoning America. Here's an antidote         This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called “positive polarization” in Richard Nixon’s 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated “the press is the enemy” like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.            Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as “fair and balanced.”           Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.           The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that “virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline.” Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren’t trusting what they see with their own eyes.           Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber – a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.            Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.             All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on “Fox and Friends,” where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.           But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn’t have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias – and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.           The Republican establishment couldn’t stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.           It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.           On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign’s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity’s many mentions in campaign emails and called him their “chief propagandist … looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.”            During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump’s orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station – Trump TV – to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he’d begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.           But trolls and bots on social media – many of them connected to Russia – were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook – designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton – out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.           The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis’ (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks’ “confirmation” of Hillary Clinton’s weapons sales to ISIS – which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that “it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.”           President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term “fake news” – which helped him win the election – to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.     Trump's 'social media summit' isn't fearsome, it's pitiful         Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump’s relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history – with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool.           When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox – while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.           “I’ve never seen anything like it before,” Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer. “It’s as if the President had his own press organization. It’s not healthy.”           We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House – electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.             The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine – not Russia – had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country’s new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani – who fed information to The Hill’s John Solomon – whose articles created “evidence” used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity’s show on Fox News – creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President’s supporters might call “alternative facts.”      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as “Never Trumpers,” “nerdy guys,” “radicals,” “partisan bureaucrats” and even a “self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake.” There’s an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President’s talking points.            There’s no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that’s afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.            But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book “Going to Extremes,” “A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk.”           Partisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge – undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides.           Confronting this blizzard of lies is one of the defining challenges of our times. To reunite our nation, we must reassert the old wisdom that says everyone is entitled to their own opinion – but not their own facts – and report without fear or favor. As James Madison said two centuries ago, “To the press alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

E. Wesley Ely is a physician and the Grant. W. Liddle Professor of Medicine and Critical Care at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee Valley VA GRECC, and the founder of the Vanderbilt ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group. The views expressed here are solely his.         “But can’t you help me die, Doc?”            My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.            As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients’ care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.             I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  “I want euthanasia. I’m going to die soon, so what’s the point of living longer? I’m just wasted space.”            I felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.       Share your story of how being a caregiver has changed you with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we’d walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn’t pay anything to Mom, who didn’t make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.            While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.            I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient’s diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn’t change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: “Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right.” Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person’s life has value beyond measure.           I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn’t kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul’s request to die.           My response came in parts over my days with him.  First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. “Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,” I said.  “You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won’t deliberately end your life.”            With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: “Just don’t abandon me.”  And we sat there, as partners.           As a physician, there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping.             Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn’t enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him.             “I want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for ‘Lord of the Rings’?”  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  “I love music. It’s always been a motivator, but now … I don’t know.” He shifted in his bed. “My goals are gone.”           Nietzsche’s words came to my mind, “He who has a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how.’”      Viktor Frankl, as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche’s quote four times in his crucial analysis, “Man’s Search for Meaning.” I think this book should be required reading for medical students.           As with many patients, Paul’s story needed unpacking. “Paul, what did you do in life?”            He smiled and shrugged. “I’m a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know, ‘The quality of mercy is not strained.’  I’ve been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn’t understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It’s better as a natural infusion, one person to another.”            I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors.  As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.           That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven, too.            “I think I helped Christine,” Paul said the next day. “My own illness made me forget that one of my ‘things’ is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it.” He paused, his thoughts far away.           It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  “Paul, you’ve asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia’s line from ‘Merchant of Venice’ about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?”  He nodded, and closed his eyes.           “We all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don’t think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be ‘strained.’ It would be a forced and unnatural ‘false’ mercy.  Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don’t want to abandon those key elements in serving you.”           His eyes opened wide. “Doc, talking with you and Christine about life’s best and worst times has helped.”  He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  “Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she’s coming back tonight, and that means the world to me.”  Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: “When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I’m not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the ‘why’ to live.”            Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their “why,” even if just for an hour or a day.             I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical – and these paths are dynamic, not static.           It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.            Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician, I find this is a very important “teachable moment” for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: “Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.” He nodded in agreement.           Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of ‘cure,’ when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.           And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.            Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won’t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul’s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person’s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.           Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: “I’m glad I didn’t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. … In losing my breath, I gained it.”      Note: The patient’s name and age have been changed for privacy.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook         The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of ‘cure,’ when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.           And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.            Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won’t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul’s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person’s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.           Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: “I’m glad I didn’t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. … In losing my breath, I gained it.”      Note: The patient’s name and age have been changed for privacy.

opinion,Together we make a family,https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/20/opinions/what-its-like-to-be-me-disability-rebecca-cokley-opinion/index.html," Editor’s Note: This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.         I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn’t ask me. He didn’t even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, “While you’re down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?”           At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: “No!”           As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren’t seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.           The delivery room wasn’t my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn’t always perfect for me growing up.  My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, “Kids like you don’t go here, you go to the special school.” If it weren’t for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.           I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be “different” in a way that he is not.     Everyone’s “normal” is their own: Share your story of how you use being different to make a difference in your own life or others’ with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         When he comes, I’ll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I’ve always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.           With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist  – who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn’t ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business.   I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation – which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.           I don’t know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I’ve asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.           While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it’s also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.           Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).            My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world, affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.            My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.           I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor’s and master’s degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.           I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith’s latest film, “Dogma,” and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.           It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm – and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.           All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the “gay cancer,” my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.           I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, “We’re here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They’re no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we’d hope they would be here for us.”           And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.           When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. “Mom, I think I want to be clown.” She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. “What?” she asked.           “Yeah, I think I want to be a clown.” We rode home in silence. I didn’t realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.           I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.           Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller, an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read “for fun.”           My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.           Taking this path was important to me – and to my family as well.           When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school.   It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn’t have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having “midget midget” shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.           Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.           My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos, the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job – at Victoria’s Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.           You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, “You have to make someone want something they don’t need and want to pay too much for it.”            My boss at Victoria’s Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I’d have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.            I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They’d actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. “Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit.” (We all wore black suits). “Well, she’s petite.” (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.            The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were “fascinated” with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, “We could pick you up and walk out with you. We’d take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us.” I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened “spidey sense” because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.            Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth. I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away – cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by “staring at the new girl.” I have no memory of this.            Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.           Patrick is average height and African-American. I’m a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I’m the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he’s the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.           When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that’s how those of us in the community refer to “little people”) friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn’t ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height – they’d ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn’t care either way.           I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama’s White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, “I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules.” And those are really the values that we stress as we’re raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.           At age 6, Jackson’s awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, “Mom, you’re white, Dad’s black, and I’m peach.” His dad turned around and said “Peach? You’re black.” Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said “Peach!” This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.           We’ve purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It’s  important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.           Since we’re raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband’s childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can’t – and in some cases, shouldn’t – be the one to answer.           As a professional advocate, I’ve spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police – Eric Garner, Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland – were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.           Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now – their curiosity, their feeling that they’ve never met a stranger, their trust in the world – could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.           My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn’t keep it from him.           When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn’t be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well. Whether it’s forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the “well-meaning” nondisabled public for centuries.           No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.           Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent’s disability. In my work as an advocate, I’ve spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.           If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language.  Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like “special needs,” “differently abled,” or, in a pun on language from the past, “handi-capable.”           These aren’t words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with – they were defined by society because the concept of “disability” makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It’s a reminder that yes, we are different.           But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that “disability” is something to be ashamed of – say, by implying that someone shouldn’t have more children because of one – society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights.  We didn’t celebrate the 27th anniversary of the “Americans with Special Needs Act” this summer, after all.           The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT – with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police – and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.           They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live – in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims.            We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It’s impossible not to – and we would be irresponsible if we didn’t.           We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don’t have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women’s march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn’t I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, “I am the mommy,” but not a single one apologized to me.     Join us on Twitter and Facebook         As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.           Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don’t know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don’t care either way.           What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

opinion,"Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option",https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/opinions/ivf-3-7-percent-opinion-lenti/index.html," Editor’s Note: Sarah Lenti is a political strategist and policy advisor at SML Advisory Partners. She served as a director on the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and worked as a lead researcher for Mitt Romney’s 2010 book, “No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.”  The views expressed in this commentary are her own. This piece is the first of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change.   Top Republican strategist Sarah Lenti details how — against her family's wishes and conservative values —  she decided to undergo IVF to become a single parent After being told she had less than a 5% chance of conceiving -- 3.7% in fact -- she gave birth to two baby boys, Eli and Abel.        It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.           My heart dropped. She didn’t know me at all.           I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.           Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.           On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn’t exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God.           At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child.           Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.     Every family is different: Share your story of how IVF, adoption or your unique family structure has shaped your life with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day.           It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family.             If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014, marriage was on the decline, as was the fertility rate in the United States.           I had one real option left – and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone.            Maybe I didn’t deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn’t view me as acceptable wife/mother material.            But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot.           And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it – to the tune of $30,000.              Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.               But why didn’t I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation.            That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline.  I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child.           The very decade I was born into – the glorious 70’s – ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone.           More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately 5 million babies, with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States.           The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births – for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought.           And yet there I was  at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to.           My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters.           And yet I felt unloved – even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted.           On the one hand, I was ecstatic – I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown.           But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head – the voice of my parents and others – that was very much alive in me. “Why would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?”           Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it’s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.           My heart and my brain had to fight back.           No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish.  Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life – only to be greeted by my career – that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved.             Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it’s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.               As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt.           And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins – what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other.           I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle.           The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%.           Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success.           Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor – and let’s just say I took a less than conventional approach.            Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case.           I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way.           I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let’s be frank, it’s impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search.           And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to – namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline.           The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.)                I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans – at least on paper.                I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn’t you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history?           This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven’t polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family’s medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal.           I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans – at least on paper.           In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life.           D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child’s heartbeat, strong and steady.           I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought.           The cliché that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband – and I received exactly that in return.           But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins.            My journal entry from the evening read as follows:     Week 8, Day 1: October 6th D Day   Dear God: Thank you.   Baby A: your heartbeat was 159 today.   Baby B: your heartbeat was 168.   I love you A & B.  Please keep growing. You’re looking great.   Thank you, God. I pray for their development – from their fingers to their toes. From brain to nose. I am so grateful for these precious beings. Prepare me to be the strong parent – fiscally and spiritually – that they will need me to be.   Love you.         On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like.             By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section.           My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons – my sons – were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head.           And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this – not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own.             Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear – the hardest, yet best thing I’ve ever done.                 Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies’ heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check.           I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own.           The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief.  I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can’t ever get that moment back.            Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver’s premier NICU hospital – The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke’s           I was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth.           And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth.           Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU – for 60 days straight.            And though I could easily have felt alone – so removed from my two miracles – I didn’t.            Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement.            And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends – and sometimes even strangers –continued to shower us with kindness and affection.           Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day.           Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need – Adam and Teri have been there for all of it.             You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.               The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley.           And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap.           I can’t forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because.           More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday fête as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me.           Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it’s hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents – and my sisters – express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways.           There are incredible people in this world. My sons’ existences have made that real to me.           Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear – the hardest, yet best thing I’ve ever done.           My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck.           They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they’re upset. They chuck their food when they don’t like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress.  Being a single parent is hard as hell.           But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.             They are my miracles, which I almost didn’t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.               Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there – some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope.           Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn’t ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It’s my reality, and it never changes.           And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating.       Mom writes children's book to explain IVF to her son         After the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed.             The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I’ll never know.            And, most importantly, I finally no longer care.           Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who’ve taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They’ve done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn’t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.           Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost – men who broke my heart, clients who weren’t a good fit, friendships that had faded.            My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.

opinion,"We asked, you answered: How IVF and adoption changed your lives",https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/opinions/opinions-ivf-adoption-reaction/index.html,"       On Tuesday, CNN Opinion published “Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option,” a personal essay by Sarah Lenti, a political strategist who decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).  She writes: “I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.”            Lenti’s piece was the first of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores personal struggles Americans face in a time of social change.           We asked you, CNN’s audience, to share your stories of IVF and adoption through text message and WhatsApp – and you responded with personal experiences that were as various as they were emotionally compelling.           You shared with us stories of your joys and your struggles. You shared family photos – and some of you even sent us videos about your families’ journeys. Here they are.            “The article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It’s not that I don’t want a partner, I just didn’t want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime.           “(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of “traditional relationships.” That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived.”           “Blessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy.            “Our dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn’t want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea.           “We feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn’t always guarantee a baby. “           “My name is Jo Zmood. I am a single mum of two now. Originally from Australia – hence “mum” not “mom.” I’ve lived in New York for 10 years, and while there are many books out there that talk about different types of families I couldn’t quite find the right book to share with my son to provide him some explanation of my choice to bring him into this world alone. So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it.           “He never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don’t. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn’t, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo.”           “During the three years I struggled to get pregnant with my second child as a solo parent, people close to me asked if I should consider the failed pregnancies a sign to give up. I was not giving up. The years of navigating fibroid tumors, surgeries and infertility finally came to an end with the birth of my second son, Oliver. He was born with my eggs and the help of my cousin as my surrogate. My journey as a solo parent also ended when I met my husband right before learning my surrogate was pregnant with Oliver. We were both solo parents in our 40s and had never been married before. Our journey to building a family may not have taken a typical path, but what we have today is my dream come true.”            Kim Overton writes about her experience on her website.

My ex-husband couldn’t have children either so we adopted two babies within three years. The marriage ended a few years later and I remarried the following year. My new husband and I started our married life with two 4-year-olds and a 2-year-old.           “Then the surprises came. I had babies at age 35, 39, and 46 – – all conceived the old-fashioned way!”           “I am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo.           “When the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo.           “After an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away.           “What I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years – so not too long).”           “She got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone’s company at all times.           “She still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue.           “Adopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child’s brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there. But it’s tough when they bite and scratch and break things, kick you etc … But with the help of family, psychologists and relational therapy, you get it done. And now, although she’s a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times.           “What she wants the most is spending time with me, so when we can, we travel. We’ve been to Burkina Faso,  Mexico, China (went back to do some volunteer teaching for 3 months in 2009 near Qingdao), all over Europe, California, New York, Atlanta, South Carolina, Boston, Cuba … She has a map on her wall with pins of all the places she’s been. We’d like to go to Japan next!           “All in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back. Those few moments when she shows her love with no boundaries are worth all the pain I go through to be her mom. I’d do it all the same if I had to. Would not change a thing!”           “We have the most beautiful miracle from IVF. Go Science! I’m a Chinese dentist, mom is a Hispanic dietitian.

The process was faster and smoother than I could have ever imagined. My son was in my arms just four months after my home study was completed. We maintain a relationship with his birth family, which I am very thankful for. Although it hasn’t been easy, it has been worth it. He brings so much joy to myself and my family. He’s such a wonderful, loving little boy.  Even those that weren’t on board with my choice to pursue adoption at such a young age are just simply amazed at how incredibly perfect he is for our family. We love him with every ounce of our being.            “The one aspect of the adoption that I feel I wasn’t prepared for was the current environment that I am raising a black son in. I have always tried to be a strong advocate for the AA community and to stay educated, but never really understood what it meant to be black in America until I saw the world through my son’s eyes.

opinion,What happened when my dad met a bully,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/opinions/trump-bullying-and-fear-bardsley/index.html," Editor’s Note: Greg Bardsley is the author of the novels “Cash Out” (2012) and “The Bob Watson” (2016) from HarperCollins Publishers. A former columnist and speechwriter, he lives in the San Francisco Bay area. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         As a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow.           His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school.           As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn’t want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day — “Minnow, what are you gonna do?” — my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse.           Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him.     If there's anyone who can reach a deal, it's Joe Biden         When my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn’t there.           My dad waited. And waited.            The bully never showed.           My dad said he learned an important lesson that day. For bullies, fear and intimidation is their oxygen. Fear and intimidation give them power. And while some bullies will fight, a great many more are relying on you to cower — it is the secret of their power.           As things turned out, “Mellow Minnow,” as he was known, would later become a Golden Gloves boxer and would finish his career as one of the top flyweights in the United States. He said that during the Korean War, a few larger GIs made the mistake of trying to push him around.            Most people who knew my dad would never have guessed this part of his history –— that the affable, kind, quiet and self-deprecating Iowa native with bifocals and a comb-over was once a fighter, and that he would stand up for himself, for others and for what was right, if needed.     I went to Washington for joy, and Amanda Gorman delivered it         Ever since the Trump mob followed the call of their leader and descended on the Capitol on January 6, I have thought a lot about the parallels of my dad’s story and the fears many of us have felt.           Some members of Congress reportedly voted against electoral certification on January 6 because they were afraid for their physical safety. MAGA bullies threatened to descend on state capitals with more violence. They threatened to attack Washington, DC. They showed us their guns and hatred. Fear ensued, and some argued that this week’s presidential inauguration should be moved indoors. Others suggested that we should “go easy” on the insurrectionists so as not to trigger more terror and violence.           Instead, people decided to stand up to the bullies.            In recent weeks, hundreds of domestic terrorists have been arrested. People across the political spectrum have stepped up and identified radicalized friends or family members who participated in the insurrection. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in impeaching our top bully, despite numerous death threats from the mob he egged on.      If Biden wants to fix health care, he will need Republicans         Local and state Republicans have been recognized for refusing to be bullied into overturning election results in their communities. Even the losing vice president refused to leave the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, determined to execute his duty and protect our democracy even as the MAGA mob hunted for him in the Capitol, chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.”            More than 25,000 soldiers arrived in Washington DC, to face any bullies who might show up with their guns, swastikas, Confederate flags and bully clubs. And this week President Biden took the oath of office outdoors, right where the attempted coup had unfolded only fourteen days earlier. People faced their fears, and they ensured the orderly and democratic transfer of power.           People stood up to the bullies, who never showed up. That includes our top bully, who chose to flee town.      Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         This week we are reminded that fear and intimidation are diminished when people come together and stand up to the bullies. We have learned that there are enough leaders (and citizens) who will not appease — because history tells us that appeasing fascists, thugs and bullies never works. People stood up for what was right, and the bullies lost a bit of their dark power.           I wasn’t planning on sharing the story of my late father. Then this weekend as I cleaned out our office closet, I found a photo of him and his American Legion boxing team — Minnow, the little guy who faced his fears and stood up to the bully, and in doing so found new power and light.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,"Births have increased in states with abortion bans, research finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/health/abortion-bans-increase-births/index.html,"       Nearly a quarter of people seeking an abortion in the United States were unable to get one due to bans that took effect after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, researchers estimate. In the first half of 2023, states with abortion bans had an average fertility rate that was 2.3% higher than states where abortion was not restricted, according to the analysis – leading to about 32,000 more births than expected.     States with restrictive abortion laws place more kids in foster care, particularly kids of color         The findings are based on preliminary births data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research has not yet been peer-reviewed but experts say the data paints a clear picture about the direct impact of abortion restrictions.           “It’s an assault on reproductive autonomy,” said Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but has published research on the effect that a strict abortion law had on births in Texas.           “We don’t always detect signals in these population aggregates because there’s a lot of variation when you group everybody together. The fact that there is a signal at the population level means that something’s really going on. It’s pretty strong evidence.”           Fertility rates – the number of births per women of reproductive age – don’t typically change dramatically. A “shock” like Covid-19, for example, led to a “temporary baby bust,” said Gemmill, who has also researched infertility during the pandemic. The 4.5% decrease in fertility rate in the first year of the pandemic was the largest in decades, according to CDC data.     Abortions increased in the US overall in the year post-Dobbs, but there are stark inequalities state-to-state   Other research has found that the number of abortions increased nationwide in the year following the Dobbs decision, with especially large increases in states that border those with bans. But complete data on the number of abortions provided to people who crossed states lines for their care is not yet available, and the new research suggests that travel remains a significant barrier to access.           After the Dobbs decision, fertility rates increased most significantly in states with longer travel times to the nearest abortion providers, the new research found, including a 5.1% increase in Texas and a 4.4% increase in Mississippi.           Abortions have been trending up in the US for years. But rising birth rates could indicate that unmet need persists, despite an increase in the number of abortions in the year post-Dobbs.           “One might think that those data conflict,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco’s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but is co-chair of the #WeCount project that tracks abortion trends. “But in actuality, we’ve known that there are many people who still can’t get abortions.”           While some people may have been able to travel out of banned states for an abortion, abortions are likely also increasing among residents of states where it remains legal as additional resources and support help to address unmet need that existed even before Roe v. Wade was overturned, she said.     In the South, looming uncertainty threatens the limited abortion access that remains         Earlier research has found that there are many consequences of unintended birth, affecting the health and livelihood of the mother, the child and the family in general. And the new research found that abortion bans have especially affected Hispanic women, with a 4.7% increase in fertility rate in the first half of 2023, as well as younger women, with a 3.3% increase among those in their early 20s.           “Restricted access to abortion services causes this domino effect,” said Rachel Hardeman, a professor of health and racial equity at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the new research. People who do not have the resources to overcome additional barriers, such as costly travel to an out-of-state provider, may then have less opportunity to build long-term financial security.           “[The Dobbs decision] has had a profound impact on birthing people’s ability to decide what their family looks like and how they navigate that,” she said. “All of the material resources necessary for a family to not just barely survive, but to thrive in our society are going to be impacted by their ability to access health care, broadly speaking, and abortion care, specifically.”     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           Not all people who seek an abortion have an unwanted pregnancy, experts say. Some are wanted pregnancies with fetal abnormalities or other life-threatening conditions – and some of the increase in births likely includes unviable pregnancies that were carried to term.           “Infant mortality is one of these more concrete consequences that we can measure right now, and we are seeing impacts there,” Gemmill said. In Texas, for example, infant mortality increased about 12% in 2022, including a 22% spike in infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects.           “I think about these women that had to carry these gestations and give birth to them, knowing that they were likely going to die shortly after birth and the trauma related to that,” Gemmill said. “We’re just going to be learning more and more about the consequences.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,FDA considers first CRISPR gene editing treatment that may cure sickle cell,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/31/health/fda-considers-crispr-treatment-cure-sickle-cell/index.html,"       At age 45, Dr. Lakiea Bailey said, she was the oldest person with sickle cell anemia that she knew.           The executive director of the nonprofit patient advocacy group the Sickle Cell Consortium was diagnosed with sickle cell disease at age 3. Because of it, she’s had heart problems, had her hips replaced, and experienced serious pain all her life.           Bailey told the US Food and Drug Administration’s independent advisory committee Tuesday that she believes a cutting-edge therapy that is currently under review offers the sickle cell community something many haven’t ever had before: hope.           “Hope is on the horizon, and we are looking toward this hope for a change of the lives that we are living of excruciating pain,” Bailey told the FDA committee on Tuesday.     Breakthroughs in race to create lab models of human embryos raise hopes and concerns         The independent committee is helping the FDA think through how it should evaluate a treatment called exa-cel that could potentially cure people of sickle cell disease, a painful and deadly disease with no universally successful treatment.           This was an ongoing discussion with no vote or decision about the therapy, but the discussion likely moves the US one step closer to approving a groundbreaking new treatment that uses gene editing.           If approved, exa-cel, made by Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the Swiss company CRISPR Therapeutics, would be the first FDA-approved treatment that uses genetic modification called CRISPR.           CRISPR, or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, is a technology researchers use to selectively modify DNA, the carrier of genetic information that the body uses to function and develop.           The FDA said treatment for severe sickle cell is an “unmet medical need.”           When someone has sickle cell disease their red blood cells don’t function the way they should. Red blood cells are the helper cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues, which use this oxygen to produce energy. The process also generates waste in the form of carbon dioxide that the red blood cells take to the lungs to be exhaled out.           With sickle cell disease — also called sickle cell anemia — red blood cells take on a folded or sickle shape that can clog tiny blood vessels and cause progressive organ damage and pain, and can lead to organ failure. The sickle cells also die earlier than they should, which means the person is constantly short red blood cells. One person with sickle cell who testified said she had been hospitalized 100 times just last year. Median life expectancy is only 45 years.           Sickle cell is rare, and it disproportionately impacts African Americans. About 100,000 people in the US are diagnosed with sickle cell and, of those, 20,000 have what’s considered severe disease.     How a national blood shortage could impact people with sickle cell disease         Up until now, the only real treatment has been a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. For stem cells, fewer than 20% of patients have an appropriately matched donor, the FDA said, and the transplants are risky and may not work. Sometimes a transplant can kill the patient.           The new exa-cel treatment under FDA consideration can use the patient’s own stem cells. Doctors would alter them with CRISPR to fix the genetic problems that cause sickle cell, and then the altered stem cells are given back to the patient in a one-time infusion.           In company studies, the treatment was considered safe, and it had a “highly positive benefit-risk for patients with severe sickle cell disease,” Dr. Stephanie Krogmeier, vice president for global regulatory affairs with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, told the panel.           Thirty-nine of the 40 people tested with the treatment did not have a single vaso-occlusive crisis, which means the misshapen red blood cells block normal circulation and can cause moderate to severe pain. It’s the top reason patients with sickle cell go to the emergency room or are hospitalized. Before the treatment, patients experienced about four of these painful crises a year, resulting in about two weeks in the hospital.           The FDA sought the independent panel’s advice, in part, because this would be the first time the FDA would approve a treatment that uses CRISPR technology, but Dr. Fyodor Urnov, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley, reminded the committee CRISPR has been around for 30 years and, in that time, scientists have learned a lot about how to use it safely.           “The technology is, in fact, ready for primetime,” Urnov said.           With this kind of genetic editing, scientists could inadvertently make a change to a patient’s DNA that is off-target, and the therapy could harm the patient. The FDA wanted the experts’ advice so it could understand what criteria it should use to evaluate the treatment and determine how to evaluate long-term safety issues.           An FDA presentation to the panel suggested the agency may have some questions about the data. It called a lack of confirmatory testing “concerning.” It also noted the study’s small size.     How human gene editing is moving on after the CRISPR baby scandal         In a discussion of the company’s methodology, several panel experts said that they believed the data the companies have submitted for FDA approval were reasonable.     Dr. Scot Wolfe, a temporary voting member of the committee and professor at UMass Chan Medical School, said he liked that the company promised to monitor patients for 15 years to see if there were any problems down the road.           He said, generally, it was “exciting” to see how many patients have been treated and how positive the results have been so far.           As far as any concern for what’s called “off-target effects,” meaning the potential unwanted or adverse alterations to the genome that could accidentally happen in this process and cause cancer or other problems down the road, Dr. Daniel Bauer, principal investigator and staff physician at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, told the panel the risk is “relatively small.”           Wolfe thought the depth of analysis the companies used should be good enough to detect any potential problems down the road.           “We want to be careful to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Wolfe said. “At some point, you have to just try things out.”           “I think, in this case, that there’s a huge unmet need for individuals with sickle cell disease, and it’s important we think about how we can advance therapies that could potentially help them, and I certainly think this is one of them,” Wolfe added.     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           Asked by the committee how he would advise patients how to evaluate the risks with this treatment, Bauer said he would be honest that there is some uncertainty, but most of the human genome is non-coding, meaning it doesn’t provide instructions to the cells to act a certain way.           “It might be that many places in the human genome can tolerate an off-target edit and not have a functional consequence,” Bauer told the committee. In other words, if they made an editing error, it might not matter, and may not harm the patient.           “My guess is it’s a relatively small risk in the scheme of this risk benefit. But it’s new, it’s unknown,” Bauer said. “We need to be humble and open to learning from these brave patients participating.”         The FDA is expected to make an approval decision by December 8.

health,"As Earth’s temperature rises, so do deaths among people with mental health problems",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/health/mental-health-climate-change-effects-wellness/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.         As the climate crisis gets worse, we know of farmers whose crops are drying up and people who lose their homes due to rampant wildfires.           But there’s another group for whom the climate crisis is a potentially lethal threat — people with mental health problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or anxiety.           And this threat has already become reality for some people. During a record-breaking heat wave in British Columbia in June 2021, 8% of people who died from the extreme heat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to a March study. That made the disorder a more dangerous risk factor than all other conditions the authors studied, including kidney disease and coronary artery disease.           “Until climate change gets under control, things are only going to get worse unfortunately,” said Dr. Robert Feder, a retired New Hampshire-based psychiatrist and the American Psychiatric Association’s representative to the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “As the temperature keeps increasing, these effects are going to be magnified. There’s going to be more storms, more fires, and people are going to be more worried about what could happen because a lot more things are happening.”           Rising temperatures have also been associated with suicide attempts and increased rates of mental health-related emergency department visits, several studies have found. And long-term exposure to air pollution — which the climate crisis can worsen by adding more particles from droughts or wildfires — has been linked with elevated anxiety and an increase in suicides.           What’s going on in the brains of people with schizophrenia or other conditions is just one factor that makes them more vulnerable to extreme heat, air pollution and stress, experts said — and in need of support from loved ones, surrounding communities and policymakers.           What makes some psychiatric patients more susceptible to the harms of extreme heat — such as heatstroke or death — begins in a part of the brain called the anterior hypothalamus. Think of it as the body’s thermostat.           “That’s the part of the brain that is working to tell you — when you’re too hot or you’re too cold — to begin shivering, to begin sweating,” which is the body’s cooling mechanism, said Dr. Peter Crank, an assistant professor in the department of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Crank was the lead author of a March study on associations between temperatures in Phoenix, Arizona, and hospital admissions of people with schizophrenia.     Using marijuana during pregnancy may heighten risk for baby         “It tells the rest of your brain you need to take behavioral action, like drinking water or putting on a coat when it’s too cold or taking off a coat when it’s warm,” he added. “These disorders, whether it’s bipolar, schizophrenia or manic depressive — all three of them impair the neurotransmission of information to that portion of the brain.”           The capacity to regulate body temperature may also have to do with brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which are generally lower in the brains of people with these disorders, experts said.           “The hypothalamus is directly dependent upon being stimulated by serotonin,” said Dr. Joshua Wortzel, a psychiatrist at Bradley Hospital at Brown University in Rhode Island and chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s committee on climate change and mental health. “Serotonin levels in the brain are affected by temperatures outside, and so you can imagine that when we’re playing around with serotonin levels in the brain with our medicines, that can change a person’s ability to sweat.”           Some medications used to treat these disorders can add to the risk by affecting the ability to sweat or raising the body’s core temperature.           Antipsychotic medications — often used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, paranoia and delusions — have the greatest effect, Feder said. Those include aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and lurasidone.           Some stimulant medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, such as lisdexamfetamine and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts, and anti-anxiety medications can also cause this problem.     Single-use plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet. Here’s what you can do to minimize your impact         Lithium, a mood-stabilizing medicine, can cause dehydration, Feder added.           Lifestyle habits important for managing mental health symptoms can also take a hit. Warm temperatures can also interfere with sleep, an important factor for managing mental health symptoms, experts said.           Additionally, “the nature of most mental health conditions is that once you’re diagnosed with it, you are at risk for recurrent episodes of that illness,” Feder said. “And these episodes are often brought on by some type of stress. And climate disasters are certainly a stress.”           Homelessness is also high among people with mental health conditions, especially in the schizophrenic population.           “And if you’re homeless during a heat wave, that puts you at increased risk for death, because you don’t have access to air-conditioning,” Feder said.           Behaviors caused by these conditions can also contribute to a higher risk of heat-related illness or death. The psychosis that people with schizophrenia can experience, for example, can mean they’re not correctly interpreting reality, so “they may not even be aware that they’re overheated, or they may think that the source of their being overheated is due to some bizarre or irrational reason and not do something appropriate to get out of the heat or to make themselves (safer),” Feder said.           People with mental health issues are also more likely to self-medicate with drugs that interfere with their body’s ability to sense and respond to heat.           If you’re on any of these medications and think no longer taking them is the solution, not so fast. “That would be far worse than staying on the medicine,” which plays a crucial role in your treatment, Wortzel said.     Saving water can help us deal with the climate crisis. Here’s how to reduce your use         Talk with your doctor about whether a medication you’re on or starting makes you more vulnerable to extreme heat since some informational pamphlets for these drugs may not list that risk as a potential side effect.         “These are rather just cautions,” he added, “to really just make sure that you’re staying in cooler environments, making sure you’re hydrated — that if climate change continues to get worse, this is going to be really a side effect that we’re going to have to worry more and more about.”           It’s not a reason to stop taking antipsychotics, Wortzel said, but it’s good reason to take care of yourself in the heat.           Addressing the climate crisis, the root of the problem, is of course the most important solution, Wortzel said. What’s also necessary at the policy level, he added, is expanding access to cooling centers and other resources, and providing more funding for research that would help us better understand the impact of heat on mental health.     Holiday gift giving is rife with waste. Here’s how to give greener, according to experts         There are steps individuals and communities can take to protect vulnerable people when hot weather comes.           “Patients need to be aware that they are vulnerable to stress,” Wortzel said. “You need to make sure that you have access to air-conditioning, a cooling center, to stay hydrated and to make sure you’re monitoring how much you’re outside, (that) you’re not out in the hottest times of the day, things like that.”           Wear sunscreen, hats and light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, Crank said. Taking cold showers can also help keep your core temperature down.           “The other thing that people can do is start getting involved in climate activities,” Feder said. “For the anxiety that’s associated with climate change, the best thing people can do is actually get involved in climate (advocacy) groups and start working for changes to the climate crisis.”           Feder also suggested people write or talk to their lawmakers about the issue.           You should also inform your loved ones of your vulnerabilities so they can offer support.         If you’re not someone at greater risk and are wondering how you can help, practice empathy and awareness by keeping water bottles in your car to hand out to those at higher risk of harm from extreme heat.           “Take the time to, if seeing someone in distress, call some sort of emergency services so that they can get medical attention,” Crank said. Doing so will likely take only a few minutes out of your day.

health,"Cantaloupe, fruit products recalled amid CDC investigation of salmonella infections",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/health/cantaloupe-salmonella-recall/index.html,"       The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says whole and pre-cut cantaloupes have caused dozens of cases of salmonella infection, including 17 hospitalizations, in 15 states and in Canada.           Salmonella causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, and illness can start six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria, according to the CDC.           The most recent illnesses in the outbreak began November 6. A total of 43 cases have been reported, the agency said Friday, but many more people have probably been sickened.           In Canada, authorities found salmonella bacteria on cantaloupes from Mexico that was genetically related to the strain that’s making people sick.     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           The tainted cantaloupes were sold at multiple retailers. As a result of the investigation, Malichita brand whole cantaloupes from Mexico – sold in stores between October 16 and October 23 – have been recalled, as have Vinyard brand pre-cut cantaloupe and fruit products sold in Oklahoma between October 30 and November 10.           Aldi stores have recalled whole and pre-cut cantaloupe and fruit products sold in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin between October 27 and October 31.           The CDC is advising people not to eat or serve the recalled fruit. It’s also important to wash and sanitize any surfaces that may have come into contact with it.

health,What an isolated community in Africa may be able to teach about child care,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/health/parenting-childcare-hunter-gatherers-wellness-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         Mothers in the distant past may have had much more support than they do today, according to a study of an isolated community in the Republic of Congo that practices a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.           Researchers found that infants in the group, known as the Mbendjele, receive attentive care and physical contact for about nine hours per day from around 14 different caregivers.           “We lived as hunter-gatherers for 95% of our evolutionary history. It was only 10,000 years ago that we stopped,” said study coauthor Nikhil Chaudhary, a researcher at the Leverhulme Centre of Human Evolutionary Studies at the University of Cambridge.           “Contemporary hunter-gatherer societies can offer clues as to whether there are certain child-rearing systems to which infants, and their mothers, may be psychologically adapted,” Chaudhary said.           Part of the region’s nomadic BaYaka population that live in the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, the Mbendjele are a highly mobile and egalitarian group that live in multifamily camps of 20 to 80 people. The study, which published this week in the journal Developmental Psychology, described them as “immediate-return” hunter-gatherers because they don’t store food for future use.           Chaudhary and his colleagues followed a total of 18 children ages 4 years old and under across three camps, observing them for 12 hours, split into four-hour chunks over three days, to track how caregivers responded to the children in a typical day. The fieldwork took place in 2014.           “You observe for 20 seconds, then record everything for 10 seconds. You get this really rich, high-resolution map of their time,” Chaudhary said, adding the researchers took 15-minute breaks after 45 minutes of observation.     How to put a crying baby to sleep, the scientific way         They extrapolated their observations for a typical 12-hour stretch when parents might be going about their work. For example, if a child was held for four and a half hours of the nine hours of observation (accounting for researchers’ breaks), the child was assumed to be held for six out of 12 consecutive daylight hours.           The team noticed that caregivers responded to crying rapidly, via comforting, soothing, feeding, holding or affection, never scolding. The children had a high degree of physical contact and care for most of time they were observed.           The team recorded 220 bouts of crying, and caregivers responded to all but three cases — the vast majority within 25 seconds. Two situations where cries didn’t elicit a response were resolved without input from a caregiver in just a minute, but in one case, a child was left to cry for 13 minutes. Infants rarely spent time alone, and for more than nine hours of the observational period they were in close contact with a caregiver, and they were held for more than five hours.           Toddlers — between 1 ½ and 4 years — were alone for 35.7 minutes of the time studied and were in close physical contact with a caregiver for more than half the day.           What was notable, Chaudhary said, wasn’t necessarily the amount of care children received, but that mothers weren’t responsible for all of it. Other caregivers — fathers, older siblings and nonrelatives — were responsible for 38% to 46% of close care, according to the study.           While the mother responded alone to just under half of the crying bouts, more than 40% of crying episodes were resolved without any input from the mother. The mean number of caregivers other than a child’s mother was 14.4, but these weren’t all adults. Often it was an older sibling.     Lost your cool with your kid? Here’s what to do next         The study found that while young children benefited from a wide set of caregivers, they had a smaller number of key caregivers within this network, particularly when it came to responding to crying, which, the researchers said, still allowed strong attachments to form.           “The sheer number of people involved in looking after a kid. … It’s so different from the nuclear family system,” Chaudhary said.           “I think the starkest difference is how young the kids are when they start looking after babies. It is really not uncommon to see a 4- or 5-year-old soothing a (younger) child.”           Parenting experts not involved in the study said looking at different cultures offered an opportunity to reexamine assumed norms around parenting.           “Historically, parents (and especially mothers) in high-income Western countries have sometimes felt guilty for putting their children in childcare because they felt that they were somehow letting the child down by not being an exclusive caregiver,” said Jennifer Lansford, the S. Malcolm Gillis distinguished research professor of public policy and the director of the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University in North Carolina, via email.    Adults shouting at children can be as harmful to a child’s development as sexual or physical abuse, study finds         “I think the perspective from this paper suggests that children are not necessarily primed to function best with just a single caregiver and that sensitive, responsive caregiving roles can be filled by a number of people in a child’s life,” Lansford said.           Carlo Schuengel, a professor specializing in child and family studies at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, found it notable that “even in a hunter-gatherer society in which young children are in the proximity of large numbers of adults, close care is predominantly provided by a low number of selected caregivers.”           “This is yet another set of observations that show how attachment — a form of selective proximity seeking in times of stress — develops across a wide range of cultures and societies,” Schuengel said.          “The research is fascinating and important because it lets us consider alternative solutions for the conflicting demands placed on parents in other societies such as our own.”           However, he emphasized that studies of other cultures “cannot replace careful testing and evaluation of efforts we might make to further improve child care.”           Marc Bornstein, editor of the academic journal Parenting: Science and Practice, agreed. He cautioned that it was important not to overreach in interpreting such a study, given that only 18 children — eight girls and 10 boys — were involved. “How representative would a day care center with 18 children in inner-city London be of childhood … anywhere?” he asked.           He noted that child mortality was high among hunter-gatherer groups and said that the study painted “a rather rosy picture of life among the hunter-gatherer Mbendjele.”           The researchers acknowledged in the new paper that sample size is small, and a larger sample would strengthen the reliability of the findings — as would following children over longer periods.           They also noted that present-day hunter-gatherers are not “living fossils.” They are still very much modern populations, even if their ways of life might offer clues about ancient parenting techniques.

We certainly can’t take for granted that we’re adapted to that way of life,” Chaudhary said.           Nevertheless, Chaudhary said that studies of child-rearing among groups such as the Mbendjele suggest that for much of human history raising a child involved large numbers of people and that “mothers aren’t meant to manage alone.”           “The narrative around motherhood, ironically, often has sort of evolutionary and biological tones to it … women have this maternal instinct and just know how to look after a baby,” he said.           “It could not be further from the truth in terms of how much of a cooperative venture child-rearing is (among the Mbendjele) and how much support mums have.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Amazon pulling seven brands of eye drops after FDA warning,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/16/health/amazon-fda-eye-drops/index.html,"       The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to Amazon for selling several brands of eye drops that the agency considers “unapproved new drugs.”           On Monday, the FDA released a warning letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy noting that the e-commerce website was selling seven brands of eye drops marketed as treatments for conditions like pink eye, dry eyes, dust irritation and cataracts.     FDA warns 26 eye drop products, including from large store brands, could lead to eye infections and vision loss         As a result, the agency says, the products can be classified as “new drugs” that Amazon is distributing without FDA approval.           The brands included in the letter are Similasan Pink Eye Relief, the Goodbye Company Pink Eye, Can-C Eye Drops, Optique 1 Eye Drops, OcluMed Eye Drops, TRP Natural Eyes Floaters Relief and Manzanilla Sophia Chamomile Herbal Eye Drops.           Amazon says it has begun removing the products from its online marketplace.           “Safety is a top priority at Amazon,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We require all products offered in our store to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The products in question have been investigated and are in the process of being removed.”           Amazon’s sale and distribution of the eye drops – which the FDA says are not “generally accepted as safe and effective” – without prior agency approval constitutes a violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and United States Code, according to the letter.           “These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective,” the FDA’s letter says. “Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body’s natural defenses.”           Monday’s warning letter follows others from the FDA raising the alarm about eye drops.           In October, the agency warned that dozens of over-the-counter eye drop products, including those sold under store brands including CVS, Target, Walmart and Rite Aid, could lead to eye infections resulting in vision loss or blindness.           Although eye drops are supposed to be sterile, the agency reported that the facility where the drops were manufactured had “insanitary conditions” and “positive bacterial test results from environmental sampling of critical drug production areas” in the facility.           CVS, Rite Aid and Target removed the products from store shelves and websites. Cardinal Health, which had six of its Leader brand eye drops on the FDA’s list, issued a recall for the products in early November.           On Wednesday, Mumbai-based Kilitch Healthcare India Ltd., which manufactured the affected eye drops from the October recall, also issued a recall for all the eye drops on the FDA’s warning list. Kilitch Healthcare India Limited said it had not received any reports of adverse events related to the recall as of November 15.

Earlier this year, the FDA warned against using several other eye drop products due to contamination from bacteria or fungus.           In February, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged health care providers and patients to avoid using EzriCare eye drops after an investigation into bacterial contamination linked with over 80 infections across 18 states.           The infections involved a rare strain of the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never before been identified in the US. Four deaths were reported, along with 14 instances of vision loss and four cases in which eyeballs had to be surgically removed.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Bats have long been the odd ones out among mammals.           They are the only creatures in this branch of the animal kingdom capable of powered flight. Now researchers say they have discovered another unique trait, with video revealing that the serotine bat may be the first mammal known to mate without using penetration.           Also known by the scientific name Eptesicus serotinus, serotine bats mate by touching their genitals together. The male bat uses its penis more like an arm to move a protective membrane away from the female bat’s vulva, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology.   Bats have “incredible” reproductive biology that has been difficult to study given the nocturnal and secretive nature of many bat species, said study coauthor Nicolas Fasel, a bat specialist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.           “Most of the time you’ll see their backs on the wall, and you don’t see what’s really happening in front,” he said.     Bats use the same techniques as death metal singers to vocalize, study finds         However, thanks to the efforts of a Dutch bat enthusiast who set up 18 video cameras in a church in the Netherlands that was home to a roosting colony of serotine bats, Fasel and his colleagues were able to analyze 93 mating events in detail. Video of an additional four mating events involving the same species came from collaborators at a bat rescue and rehabilitation center in Ukraine.           “You can really see the copulation and see that the penis is not going inside,” Fasel said.           The footage showed that half of the recorded mating episodes lasted less than 53 minutes, while on one occasion a pair of bats stayed together in a copulative embrace for more than 12 hours. The behavior is similar to a “cloacal kiss,” a way of mating used by many birds.           What Fasel and his colleagues observed on the videos may solve a long-standing puzzle about the reproductive biology of this species of bat, and others in the same family.           The male bat’s penis is around seven times longer than its female counterpart’s vagina, and it has a heart-shaped head that is seven times wider than the vaginal opening. These are features that appear to make penetrative sex difficult, if not impossible, Fasel noted.           Teri Orr, an assistant professor and specialist in bat reproductive systems at New Mexico State University, said she was initially “astonished” to see that males may be using their genitalia as a “copulatory arm” and “maybe transferring sperm much as birds do.” Orr was not involved with the study.           “Bats use their uropatagia (tail membranes) in many unique ways such as fishing nets, to catch pups during birth and so forth and thus they are useful in many ways but perhaps an impediment during mating,” Orr said.     How zoology got female animals all wrong         “I agree that the male of this species may use his genitalia to navigate the female’s tail but there are some key things to be sorted out,” she added via email. “For one: how is the sperm transferred exactly and for another what is the female doing in this pair?”           The behavior of the serotine bat reported in the paper is “bizarre and unique” if true, said Alan Dixson, a biology professor at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and the author of the 2021 book “Mammalian Sexuality: The Act of Mating and the Evolution of Reproduction.” However, in his view, the researchers hadn’t provided sufficient evidence to support their unusual claim, added Dixson, who also was not a part of the study.           Study coauthor Susanne Holtze, a senior scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, acknowledged that they had not been able to definitively prove the transfer of sperm from male to female bats and said that will be a focus of future research.           “It’s a bit of an open question how their semen really gets into the female reproductive tract. It might be that there’s kind of suction involved. We cannot fully answer this mechanism,” she said.           Holtze, who specializes in assisted reproduction in animals, said that the information they uncovered during the study would help with her work to come up with a way to artificially inseminate bats.           “There are more than 1,000 species of bats, and many of them are also endangered, she said. “So far, no sufficient strategy for assisted reproduction has been established.”           Orr, the bat specialist at New Mexico State University, said the study would inform her lab’s work on bat reproduction and whether the unusual reproductive behavior has any implications for understanding human infertility.           “Bats do a lot of extreme things during reproduction from storing sperm to extending the duration of a pregnancy,” she explained.           There are few bat biologists, and most tend to focus on the more obvious yet still fascinating aspects of bat biology such as flight and echolocation, “rather than what the bats are doing ‘behind closed doors,’” Orr said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Joe Marino/UPI/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/world/senators-faster-faa-approval-commercial-space-flight-scn/index.html,"       The top two lawmakers on the US Senate’s space and science subcommittee are pushing federal regulators to accelerate the approval of commercial space launches, arguing that the current pace could cost the United States its edge in the new space race.           In a letter sent last week to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration’s commercial spaceflight office, Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Eric Schmitt implored FAA associate administrator Kelvin Coleman to “act now” to eliminate red tape and reduce delays in processing launch and return to Earth — or reentry — licenses.           “As the pace of launches from U.S. commercial spaceflight companies increases and China’s state-backed space industry continues to grow, it is imperative that the processes at the FAA and other federal agencies adapt to keep pace with American innovation as well as adversarial threats in space,” the senators wrote in a letter dated November 14.           The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation is responsible for protecting public safety while simultaneously greenlighting a growing number of commercial space launches, which have quadrupled in just four years. The FAA has already licensed 104 launches this year, compared to 26 launches in 2019.           “Keeping pace with industry demand is a priority and is important for several reasons, including meeting our national security and civil exploration needs,” an FAA spokesperson told CNN in a statement on Tuesday.  “We’re working diligently to attract, hire and retain additional staff.”           In their letter, the senators named NASA’s commercial partners involved in the agency’s flagship human spaceflight program and urged Coleman to fast-track “high priority missions such as returning Americans to the moon.”           Elon Musk’s SpaceX is responsible for developing the lunar lander — called Starship — that will ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. During a hearing last month before the Senate space and science subcommittee, a top SpaceX executive accused government regulators of stifling the company’s progress on Starship, a pivotal part of NASA’s Artemis program and the most powerful rocket ever built.           “It’s a shame when our hardware is ready to fly, and we’re not able to go fly because of regulations or review,” said William Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president for build and reliability, noting that the company had been ready for more than a month to launch the next Starship test flight. “Licensing, including environmental (review), often takes longer than rocket development. This should never happen. And it’s only getting worse.”           The remarks came as SpaceX was the subject of a lengthy environmental review by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a safety review by the FAA after the company’s first test flight of its massive moon rocket exploded about four minutes after lifting off in April. Regulators gave SpaceX the green light to proceed last week, and the company completed a partially successful second test flight on Saturday.           In the letter dated the day before the FAA granted the launch license for Starship’s second test flight, Chairwoman Sinema, an independent from Arizona, and Senator Schmitt of Missouri, the top Republican on the subcommittee, told Coleman they were “troubled” by witnesses saying regulatory delays could enable China to continue to close the once-wide gap between itself and the US in space. Beijing is leading a parallel effort to NASA’s Artemis program by attempting to land Chinese astronauts on the same region of the moon and at roughly the same time.           “It is no secret that the United States is in a space race with China — our chief economic and military adversary. We cannot be our own worst enemy when it comes to beating China to the moon and Mars,” Schmitt told CNN.           The senators are now asking Coleman to respond to several questions, including what additional resources he may need to accelerate the launch licensing process, by November 28.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Eric Gay/AP,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/18/world/elon-musk-spacex-starship-launch-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         SpaceX’s gargantuan deep-space rocket system, Starship, safely lifted off Saturday morning but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal.           The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft successfully separated after liftoff, as the Starship lit up its engines and pushed away. That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey.           The Starship system made it much farther into flight than the first attempt in April. The rocket and spacecraft lifted off the launchpad at 8 a.m. ET, with the Super Heavy booster igniting all 33 of its Raptor engines. Even during ground tests, SpaceX has had a hard time getting all of those engines, clustered together at the base of the rocket, to power on consistently at the same time.           The Starship upper stage had begun its trip Saturday morning strapped to the top of the Super Heavy first stage, a 232-foot-tall (70.7-meter-tall) rocket. About two and a half minutes after roaring to life and vaulting off the launchpad, the Super Heavy booster expended most of its fuel, and the Starship spacecraft fired its own engines and broke away.           The Starship spacecraft used its own six engines to continue propelling itself to faster speeds. SpaceX aimed to send the spacecraft to near orbital velocities, typically around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship climbed to an altitude of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface, reaching the edge of space.           The US government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth’s surface the edge of outer space. Internationally, the Kármán line, located 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level, is often used to mark the boundary between our planet and space — but there’s a lot of gray area.           The SpaceX team awaited acquisition of signal from the spacecraft, but shared during the livestream that the “second stage was lost.”           “The automated flight termination system on second stage appears to have triggered very late in the burn as we were headed down range out over the Gulf of Mexico,” aerospace engineer John Insprucker said.           The flight termination system is essentially a self-destruct feature that SpaceX engaged to prevent the Starship from traveling off course.           “The booster experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after stage separation while Starship’s engines fired for several minutes on its way to space,” SpaceX shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.”           The Federal Aviation Administration, which licensed the Starship’s test flight today, issued a statement after the test flight.           “A mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-2 launch from Boca Chica, Texas, on Saturday, Nov. 18. The anomaly resulted in a loss of the vehicle. No injuries or public property damage have been reported,” according to an FAA spokesperson.           The agency will conduct a mishap investigation to determine the root cause of the loss of Starship, which is standard procedure.           “A return to flight of the Starship Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” according to the FAA.           It took more than four months for the FAA to complete the last mishap investigation after Starship’s test flight in April.           NASA is investing up to $4 billion in the rocket system with the goal of using the Starship capsule to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for its Artemis III mission, currently slated to take off as soon as 2025.           The endeavor is aiming to return humans to the moon for the first time in five decades, and the successful completion of this test flight would have brought the US space agency and SpaceX one step closer to that goal.           “Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared on X. “Spaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today’s test is an opportunity to learn — then fly again. Together @NASA and @SpaceX will return humanity to the Moon, Mars & beyond.”     Watch: Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon         “Each test represents a step closer to putting the first woman on the Moon with the #Artemis III Starship human landing system. Looking forward to seeing what can be learned from this test that moves us closer to the next milestone,” Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, shared on X.           The failure could spell significant delays for Starship’s development and the key missions lined up on its manifest, most notably NASA’s Artemis III mission. The US space agency tapped Starship in 2021 to serve as the lunar lander for that mission.           The root cause of the Starship rocket’s failure on Saturday was not immediately clear.           But the booster explosion occurred after a phase called “hot staging” that SpaceX tried for the first time Saturday.           The method was used to separate the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket after liftoff.           Almost all rockets go through a process during launch called “stage separation,” in which the bottommost rocket booster diverges from the rest of the rocket or spacecraft.           When SpaceX launches its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, for example, the first-stage booster — or the bottommost portion of the rocket — breaks away from the upper part of the rocket less than three minutes into flight. The Falcon 9 does so using pneumatic pushers that are housed within the rocket’s interstage, or black band around the center.           Instead, the Starship spacecraft fired up its own engines to push itself away from the Super Heavy booster — and it’s essentially separation by blunt force trauma.           It marked a crucial moment for SpaceX, as hot staging was expected to be “the riskiest part of the flight,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in October.           SpaceX had already said it would consider the mission a success if Starship made it past hot staging.           But after hot staging, the Super Heavy booster began tumbling out of control and exploded over the Gulf of Mexico just moments later. SpaceX had hoped to reignite the Super Heavy’s engines and guide it to a controlled landing.           “We did know that hot staging was going to be incredibly dynamic,” said Kate Tice, senior manager of SpaceX Quality Systems Engineering, during the livestream. We knew that there was a chance that the booster would not survive, but we’re going to take that data and figure out how we can make the booster better for the next hot stage.”           Initially, the Starship spacecraft continued moving along after separation.           About eight minutes after liftoff, cheers could be heard echoing throughout mission control as the Starship was approaching the end of its engine burn — putting it on a path toward Earth’s orbit. But nine minutes after launch, SpaceX made it clear that it lost video signal with Starship.           And about 11.5 minutes into the flight, the company confirmed it had lost data, indicating Starship wasn’t flying as planned. Then, the spacecraft’s flight termination system was triggered to prevent it from veering off course, bringing an early end to the test flight.           If all had gone according to plan, Starship would have continued accelerating toward space.

SpaceX’s gargantuan deep-space rocket system, Starship, safely lifted off Saturday morning but ended prematurely with an explosion and a loss of signal.           The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft successfully separated after liftoff, as the Starship lit up its engines and pushed away. That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey.           The Starship system made it much farther into flight than the first attempt in April. The rocket and spacecraft lifted off the launchpad at 8 a.m. ET, with the Super Heavy booster igniting all 33 of its Raptor engines. Even during ground tests, SpaceX has had a hard time getting all of those engines, clustered together at the base of the rocket, to power on consistently at the same time.           The Starship upper stage had begun its trip Saturday morning strapped to the top of the Super Heavy first stage, a 232-foot-tall (70.7-meter-tall) rocket. About two and a half minutes after roaring to life and vaulting off the launchpad, the Super Heavy booster expended most of its fuel, and the Starship spacecraft fired its own engines and broke away.           The Starship spacecraft used its own six engines to continue propelling itself to faster speeds. SpaceX aimed to send the spacecraft to near orbital velocities, typically around 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship climbed to an altitude of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface, reaching the edge of space.           The US government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth’s surface the edge of outer space. Internationally, the Kármán line, located 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level, is often used to mark the boundary between our planet and space — but there’s a lot of gray area.           The SpaceX team awaited acquisition of signal from the spacecraft, but shared during the livestream that the “second stage was lost.”           “The automated flight termination system on second stage appears to have triggered very late in the burn as we were headed down range out over the Gulf of Mexico,” aerospace engineer John Insprucker said.           The flight termination system is essentially a self-destruct feature that SpaceX engaged to prevent the Starship from traveling off course.           “The booster experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after stage separation while Starship’s engines fired for several minutes on its way to space,” SpaceX shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. “With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today’s test will help us improve Starship’s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.”           The Federal Aviation Administration, which licensed the Starship’s test flight today, issued a statement after the test flight.           “A mishap occurred during the SpaceX Starship OFT-2 launch from Boca Chica, Texas, on Saturday, Nov. 18. The anomaly resulted in a loss of the vehicle. No injuries or public property damage have been reported,” according to an FAA spokesperson.           The agency will conduct a mishap investigation to determine the root cause of the loss of Starship, which is standard procedure.           “A return to flight of the Starship Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety,” according to the FAA.           It took more than four months for the FAA to complete the last mishap investigation after Starship’s test flight in April.           NASA is investing up to $4 billion in the rocket system with the goal of using the Starship capsule to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for its Artemis III mission, currently slated to take off as soon as 2025.           The endeavor is aiming to return humans to the moon for the first time in five decades, and the successful completion of this test flight would have brought the US space agency and SpaceX one step closer to that goal.           “Congrats to the teams who made progress on today’s flight test,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared on X. “Spaceflight is a bold adventure demanding a can-do spirit and daring innovation. Today’s test is an opportunity to learn — then fly again. Together @NASA and @SpaceX will return humanity to the Moon, Mars & beyond.”     Watch: Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon         “Each test represents a step closer to putting the first woman on the Moon with the #Artemis III Starship human landing system. Looking forward to seeing what can be learned from this test that moves us closer to the next milestone,” Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, shared on X.           The failure could spell significant delays for Starship’s development and the key missions lined up on its manifest, most notably NASA’s Artemis III mission. The US space agency tapped Starship in 2021 to serve as the lunar lander for that mission.           The root cause of the Starship rocket’s failure on Saturday was not immediately clear.           But the booster explosion occurred after a phase called “hot staging” that SpaceX tried for the first time Saturday.           The method was used to separate the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket after liftoff.           Almost all rockets go through a process during launch called “stage separation,” in which the bottommost rocket booster diverges from the rest of the rocket or spacecraft.           When SpaceX launches its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, for example, the first-stage booster — or the bottommost portion of the rocket — breaks away from the upper part of the rocket less than three minutes into flight. The Falcon 9 does so using pneumatic pushers that are housed within the rocket’s interstage, or black band around the center.           Instead, the Starship spacecraft fired up its own engines to push itself away from the Super Heavy booster — and it’s essentially separation by blunt force trauma.           It marked a crucial moment for SpaceX, as hot staging was expected to be “the riskiest part of the flight,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in October.           SpaceX had already said it would consider the mission a success if Starship made it past hot staging.           But after hot staging, the Super Heavy booster began tumbling out of control and exploded over the Gulf of Mexico just moments later. SpaceX had hoped to reignite the Super Heavy’s engines and guide it to a controlled landing.           “We did know that hot staging was going to be incredibly dynamic,” said Kate Tice, senior manager of SpaceX Quality Systems Engineering, during the livestream. We knew that there was a chance that the booster would not survive, but we’re going to take that data and figure out how we can make the booster better for the next hot stage.”           Initially, the Starship spacecraft continued moving along after separation.           About eight minutes after liftoff, cheers could be heard echoing throughout mission control as the Starship was approaching the end of its engine burn — putting it on a path toward Earth’s orbit. But nine minutes after launch, SpaceX made it clear that it lost video signal with Starship.           And about 11.5 minutes into the flight, the company confirmed it had lost data, indicating Starship wasn’t flying as planned. Then, the spacecraft’s flight termination system was triggered to prevent it from veering off course, bringing an early end to the test flight.           If all had gone according to plan, Starship would have continued accelerating toward space. The Starship spacecraft was then slated to complete nearly one full lap of Earth, aiming to splash down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.     Environmental groups sue FAA for SpaceX launch that exploded in April         The destruction of the vehicle shortly after liftoff was reminiscent of the Starship’s first launch attempt in April.

Up next for end-of-year celestial spectaculars is the Leonid meteor shower, set to produce bright meteors with persistent trains streaking across the night sky.           The Leonids have been active since early November but are expected to peak this weekend at 12:33 a.m. ET Saturday, according to EarthSky. Sky-gazers could see 10 to 15 meteors per hour in a dazzling display.           Those looking to catch a glimpse of a meteor from this shower are in luck because the moon will be in its waxing crescent phase, and there will not be as much light interference as there is with a full moon, said Dr. Sharon Morsink, a professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. The moon will be 23% full on the night of the shower’s peak, according to the American Meteor Society.     Galaxy clusters dazzle in new image captured by Hubble and Webb         While the peak is on Saturday, the same rates of meteors can be seen a few days before and afterward. The best time to view the shower will be after midnight in any time zone when the constellation Leo will be the highest in the sky, said Morsink, who also manages the university’s astronomical observatory. Leo is the meteor shower’s radiant, which is the point where the phenomenon appears to originate from, she explained.           “The most important thing is to get away from light pollution,” Morsink said. “You can still see some meteors if you’re in the city, but you’re not going to see anywhere near the number that you get to see if you get out of the city.”           The Leonids are famed for generating meteor storms, the term used when a shower reaches rates of at least 1,000 meteors per hour, according to NASA.           Holding the record for the highest rate of meteors per hour seen in a meteor stream, the Leonids produced 144,000 meteors per hour in 1966, according to the American Meteor Society. The shower also produced outbursts of higher rates in 1999 and 2001, but the society does not expect another storm until 2099, when the Earth is predicted to encounter a dense cloud of debris from the parent comet, Tempel-Tuttle.           As the comet travels around the sun, it leaves a trail of rocks and dust that appears as the annual Leonid meteor shower when Earth moves through the debris while on its own orbital path.     Webb telescope spots the most distant Milky Way-like galaxy yet         Although a Leonid storm event is not predicted for this year, there is always a chance to see a few more meteors than the predicted rate, Morsink said.           “Getting out and seeing any meteor shower for the first time is always fun,” she said. “It’s just this interesting connection that we have with the whole solar system — here’s this comet that is far away from us that has been circling the sun for an incredibly long period, billions of years probably. … It’s a way for us to connect with things that are really far away.”           Meteors from the Leonids are expected to be seen blazing in the sky until the shower’s finality on December 2, according to the American Meteor Society.

Walking your dog is a fantastic way to get in shape, and it benefits both you and your pooch.           Some 69 million US households are home to at least one dog. Yet many dog owners never take their pets on a walk, or do so infrequently. Additionally, while 61% of dog owners walked their pup at least 10 minutes at a time, according to a 2011 survey in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health, only 27% walked their dog 150 minutes per week — the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for adults’ weekly, moderate-intensity physical activity.           If you’re among those who are not that physically active, use your pooch as inspiration to head outside and start moving.           “If you can keep your dog happy and healthy at the same time that you’re keeping yourself healthy and bettering the dog-man bond, that’s great,” said Dr. Jerry Klein, chief veterinary officer with the American Kennel Club. Canine obesity is the No. 1 preventive health problem in American dogs, Klein added.     Affection from a dog really is medicinal, according to a new study         Various studies indicate those who walk their dogs are more than 2.5 times as likely to achieve moderate-intensity physical activity, according to a 2015 journal article. That’s one reason the American Kennel Club created the AKC Fit Dog program. Any dog owner who walks their pet at least 30 minutes five times per week for at least three months receives a free magnet. You’re also eligible if you walk your dog at least 15 minutes 10 times per week for a minimum of three months.           As with humans, regular walks are crucial for a dog’s mental and physical health. “Getting your dog out in nature, getting fresh air and sunlight, is just as beneficial for dogs as for people,” said Dr. Victoria Tomasino, owner and medical director at GoodVets Boynton Beach and GoodVets Delray in Palm Beach County, Florida. “It awakens the senses in both parties.”           This combination of mental and physical stimulation can also help quash problematic canine behaviors. “Most dogs are bored to death,” said Dawn Celapino, founder of Leash Your Fitness, a San Diego-based business where clients and their dogs work out together. “They need mental stimulation and bonding with their owner, but a lot of people don’t realize that.”           Before grabbing a leash, keep some things in mind, Klein said. Your dog should know basic commands such as sit, stay and come. Make sure to slowly increase your walking time and mileage, as dogs need to acclimate to new levels of exercise just as humans do.           Flat-faced breeds such as pugs have breathing issues and can’t do a lot of high-intensity or lengthy workouts, while a vet should sign off on any new activity for older dogs. All breeds can struggle with excessive heat or cold, too, so always check the weather.           “You also have to be able to read your dog,” Klein said. “If your dog isn’t cooperating or doesn’t seem interested in a walk, try to find something different.”           Tomasino agreed that not all dogs enjoy walks. “You see quite often that dogs who are supposed to be high-energy prefer to be couch potatoes,” she said. “It comes down to personality, and you have to respect that.”           Thankfully, there are plenty of other ways to be active with your pooch. You can hike, swim, bike, in-line skate , play Frisbee or do circuit training with your dog. There are herding and retrieving events, both organized and competitive, that mimic the activities certain dogs were bred to do. You can harness yourself to a larger-breed dog and cross-country ski together, a sport known as skijoring, or try canicross.

health,5 things to do when you’re depressed,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/health/self-care-depression-tips-wellness/index.html," Editor’s note: Season 8 of the podcast Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta gets back to basics with an in-depth examination of the brain in different states. Each episode will focus on one of those states — the distracted brain, the frightened brain, the nourished brain, etc. — to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it affects our bodies.   (CNN) — Depression is going up in the United States. Chances are if you don’t struggle with the condition, you almost certainly know someone who does.           Nearly 18% of US adults — more than 1 in 6 — said they are currently depressed or getting treatment for depression, according to a 2023 Gallup Poll. In 2015, when Gallup first started collecting information on the topic, the number was under 11%.           Gallup’s data shows that clinical depression was slowly rising in the country before the pandemic, but it grew faster in its aftermath, with social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection, psychological exhaustion, substance abuse and disruption in mental health care all taking a toll. Rates among women, young adults, and Black and Hispanic adults are rising the fastest.     Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.           For adolescents, ages 12 to 17, the statistics are also dire: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 million kids in that age group — just over 20% — experienced an episode of major depression in 2021 (the most recent year with available data), with 3.7 million experiencing severe impairment.           Psychiatrist Charles Raison, a professor of human ecology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he has struggled with depression himself. Raison, who is also the director of the Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Center and a former mental health expert for CNN Health, described the state of mental health in the Unites States in one word: “bad.”           “There is just no doubt that depression and anxiety and suicide and substance abuse have been on the rise in the United States … for probably 20, 25 years, maybe longer,” Raison told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the podcast Chasing Life. “But they’ve really been on the rise over the last 10 years, and the data are really consistent.           “The rise is not equal amongst all age groups,” Raison said. “The people that are really suffering are young people. So, people between the ages of like 15 and 35, that’s where you see this really, really disturbing increase.”           While the rise of depression among Americans is alarming, what’s also unsettling is the difficulty in pinpointing the cause. We can’t see it on a brain scan. We don’t have a blood test for it. We can’t measure its severity accurately.           Raison compared depression to “dropsy” — an old-fashioned term for edema — which could be caused by different underlying conditions or factors. “It could be … heart failure. It could be pneumonia. It could be cancer. There (are) different reasons to produce those symptoms,” he said.           “Will we ever find a test for diagnosing depression? No, because depression is like dropsy …,” he said, pointing to possible different underlying causes. “Depression is not a single thing that’s going to yield itself to a single test.”     Seasonal affective disorder doesn’t mean you have to be SAD. Here are 6 ways to fight the blues         And that may be one reason why depression is so challenging to treat.           Take antidepressants such as Prozac, also known by the generic name fluoxetine. It was launched in the country 35 years ago as the first in a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. The idea was depression resulted from a chemical imbalance in the brain, and the imbalance could be corrected by targeting the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, which target two neurotransmitters, followed in 1993.           But antidepressants don’t work for everyone.           “The question of the use of antidepressants, which are the first-line treatment for depression in the United States, is incredibly complex,” Raison said, noting that they are “lifesavers for some folks.”           “But as we’ve gone along in the last 20 years, we’ve had to metabolize, as a field, a number of very hard truths about antidepressants and their effectiveness,” he said. “One hard truth, and the most obvious one, is that they don’t work nearly as well as we thought they did 30 years ago,” estimating that only 30% of patients “get a full response.”           To hear what promising new treatments are being tried for depression, listen to the full episode of Chasing Life here:           Raison acknowledged that trying to do anything when you are depressed is an uphill battle. He offered these five tips for self-care.           Make an appointment with a mental health professional.           “If you’re feeling unremittingly down, if you’ve lost interest in life, if your sleep and your appetite are altered, if you feel hopeless, if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself, these sorts of things — that’s what depression is,” Raison said. Getting help is especially important if you’ve experienced those symptoms for a couple of months.           “All of us who struggle with depression know that having a clinician … can help you — either with psychotherapy or medications … or both,” he said.           It turns out that what is good for the body is also good for the brain.     Is exercise or medication better for depression? Experts weigh in         “Really try to do the sort of things that you would do for your physical health,” Raison said. “I often tell people, ‘Think about what you’d do if you wanted to deal with your heart health and do the same thing.’ All those things are also antidepressants. So managing body weight, eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, getting sunlight.”           Try to maintain close relationships.           “(Tip) No. 3 is sometimes very hard when you’re depressed. … But it is probably the single most important thing, which is trying to maximize our interpersonal connections with other people,” Raison said.           “If you have caring, smaller, supportive relationships with other people, it’s a big protective factor against getting depressed. It’s also a factor that can really help you get over depression.”           Be persistent in seeking help.     Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have been diagnosed with depression and the prevalence varies dramatically by state, CDC report finds         “The way people, especially in United States, respond to antidepressant medications tends to be very bifurcated,” Raison said. “There’s a smaller group of people that just start an antidepressant, and they feel better within a couple of weeks and … and the depression goes away,” while others struggle with chronic depression.           So, if one antidepressant doesn’t work, he said, “Try another.”           But don’t be afraid to move on. “We’ve known for a long time, for instance, that people who don’t respond to a bunch of antidepressants in a row are less likely to respond to the next one, but they’re not less likely to respond to psychotherapy,” he said.           Generate a state of thankfulness.           “Work on developing an attitude of gratitude,” Raison said.           Raison admits doing so is not always easy when you’re depressed. “If you can make it a habit, it can be very powerful both to prevent depression, but also to feel better if you are depressed,” he said.     We hope these five tips help you better care for a depressed brain. Listen to the full episode here.

health,"Developing multiple health conditions, including cancer, linked to ultraprocessed foods",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/14/health/ultraprocessed-food-disease-wellness/index.html," Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.         Eating higher amounts of ultraprocessed food raises the risk of being diagnosed with multimorbidity, or having multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, a new study found.     Cutting 1 teaspoon of salt works as well as blood pressure meds, study finds         “What is particularly significant in this large study is that eating more ultra-processed foods, in particular animal products and sweetened beverages, was linked to an increased risk of developing cancer along with another disease such as a stroke or diabetes,” said Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at World Cancer Research Fund International, which funded the study, in a statement.           However, the increased risk was modest, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study.           “This paper reports a 9% increase in risk of multimorbidity to be associated with higher intake of ultraprocessed food,” Sanders said in a statement.           “Food intake was measured by a questionnaire on one occasion a long time ago. This is important as dietary patterns have changed quite markedly in the past twenty five years with more food eaten outside the home and more ready prepared food being purchased,” Sanders said.           While the study cannot conclusively prove that ultraprocessed foods are the direct cause of the multiple diseases, a good deal of other research has shown a connection between certain ultraprocessed foods (UPF) and health harms, said nutrition researcher Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in Norwich, United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.           “Taken with all the other scientific evidence it is very likely that some types of UPF do increase the risk of later disease, either because they are directly harmful or because they replace healthier foods such as vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, olive oils, etc,” Johnson said in a statement.     Foods that improve brain function and mood         The study’s findings are concerning because in Europe ultra-processed foods make up “more than half of our daily food intake,” said coauthor Heinz Freisling, a nutrition and metabolism scientist at the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in a statement. In the United States, a 2019 study estimated some 71% of the food supply may be ultraprocessed.           Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.           The list of additives includes preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings and dyes; anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents; and added or altered sugar, salt and fats designed to make food more appealing.           The study, published Monday in the journal The Lancet, collected dietary information from 266,666 men and women from seven European countries between 1992 and 2000. Researchers followed the participants for 11 years to see who developed various chronic conditions, including cancer.           As they entered the study, each person was asked to recall what they typically ate over the last 12 months, and researchers categorized the foods by the NOVA classification system, which looks beyond nutrients to how foods are made.           “To estimate it researchers had to break down foods into different ingredients to try and work out if it is ultra-processed or not,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Mellor was not involved in the study.     What you need to know about the FDA’s proposed ban of brominated vegetable oil         “This approach, especially as the food data is up to 30 years old, could make this type of interpretation of historical data using a modern definition open to error,” Mellor said in a statement.           When ultraprocessed foods were examined by subgroups, not all appeared to be associated with developing multiple chronic conditions, said lead author Reynalda Córdova, a postdoctoral student in pharmaceutical, nutritional and sport sciences at the University of Vienna.           “While certain groups, such as animal products and artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages, were associated with increased risk, other groups, such as ultra-processed breads and cereals or alternative plant-based products, showed no association with risk,” Córdova said in a statement.           “Our study emphasizes that it is not necessary to completely avoid ultra-processed foods; rather, their consumption should be limited, and preference be given to fresh or minimally processed foods,” co-author Freisling said in a statement.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Being a nice person is not the same as being kind. Why the difference is so important,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/13/health/nice-vs-kind-difference-wellness/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.         When my father died of bone cancer last year, I received an outpouring of messages from friends and family sharing their condolences.           While I appreciated everyone who reached out, I was especially grateful for two of my former college roommates who surprised my family with a delivery of bagels for breakfast. Although there was a mix-up with the address and we never saw those bagels, this act of kindness stuck with me. It was the intention that mattered more than the actual food.           There’s a difference between nice and being kind—even our bodies recognize the distinction. Kindness not only pours a lot of good into the world, but it’s also good for one’s own health. It doesn’t take much to harness the power of kindness, and it can be as simple as wishing someone a good day over text.           When was the last time you were nice? You might recall saluting a veteran for their service or greeting a stranger. Being nice involves being polite and pleasing to others. This might feel less authentic and rewarding than performing kind acts, said Dr. Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of the upcoming book, “The Joy of Imperfect Love.”           “If you’re people pleasing, you’re placing an expectation on the person you’re being nice to that they respond to you in a certain way,” Manly said.           Niceness can be used as a social strategy to get into someone’s good graces, she said. Think about the last time you complimented someone’s outfit but didn’t actually mean it. Did you do it to make them like you or did you feel obligated to comment on their new look since everyone else did?     The health benefits of a simple act         Being kind is less self-serving, said Dr. Ash Nadkarni, an associate psychiatrist and director of wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. On the one hand, kindness involves being generous without expecting to get nothing in return. The other half is the purpose behind the action. A kind person is acting out of compassion and genuine concern for another.           The difference is intentionality, said Dr.Catherine Franssen, an associate professor of psychology at Longwood University in Virginia, noting that a kind person tries to really understand what someone else is going through.           Practicing kindness rather than niceness allows people to foster deeper genuine connections with others, said Franssen. The more you do it, the easier it will get to relate to others and build more meaningful relationships in all aspects of life.           When people act kindly, the brain releases a hormone called oxytocin. Popularly known as the “love hormone,” oxytocin is used to promote social connection with others. Nadkarni said that the influx of oxytocin in the brain dampens activity in the amygdala, a region involved in fear and anxiety. “It suppresses the fear sensation and has a powerful impact on the socioemotional functions of the brain.”           If you have ever felt less stressed from helping others, it’s all thanks to the calming effects of oxytocin. It reduces cortisol, the stress hormone that triggers inflammation and a fight-or-flight response when the body senses a potential threat, be it a wild animal or an email from your boss.     What is the mental load? Men are talking about it and how they can take part         Along with less cortisol, Nadkarni said oxytocin helps with keeping your heart strong and healthy. The hormone releases nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and, in turn, reduces blood pressure.           “Oxytocin has wide-ranging functions and is really impactful to our health,” said Nadkarni. “Not only does it enhance social connection and improve cardiovascular health, but it also ensures inflammation goes down. (Chronic) inflammation is the basis for a lot of different diseases such as diabetes and depression.”           The warm feeling you get from performing an act of kindness is your brain releasing a ton of feel-good chemicals. Franssen said being kind boosts production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood, including happiness. Kindness also releases dopamine, a brain chemical in charge of reward and pleasure. It’s the reason why doing one act of kindness feels so good that you want to do another.     The significant health benefits of walking backward         Franssen said kindness can secrete endorphins, chemicals in the body that activate the opiate system — the same hormones that make up a runner’s high. Endorphins promote pleasure and act as a natural pain reliever for both physical and emotional pain. “When we do kind things for others and somebody does something unkind to us, it does not feel as bad,” she added.     Random acts of kindness you can do today         Being kind gives the same health benefits, regardless of how big or small the gesture. Below are some good deeds you can do, starting right now.           ●      Pick up litter           ●      Check in on a friend who is going through a rough patch           ●      Donate blood           ●      Text someone good morning           ●      Hold the door open for someone           ●      Surprise your parents with a visit           ●      Send a positive message           ●      Leave a generous tip for a server           ●      Be an active listener           ●      Cook a meal for someone in need           Acts of kindness might feel strange and out-of-character at first. However, Manly said this feeling goes away the more you keep practicing. Soon enough, it becomes so familiar you’ll notice the benefits on yourself and others.

health,Seasonal affective disorder doesn’t mean you have to be SAD. Here are 6 ways to fight the blues,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/12/health/seasonal-affective-disorder-self-care-wellness/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.         Some people might have looked forward to the extra hour of sleep after Daylight Saving Time ended recently, but for millions of people, the shorter days and longer nights are another reminder about the coming of winter (blues).     When daylight saving ends, don’t be surprised if you feel these health impacts         Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that occurs in late fall and winter that has to do with the lack of sunlight.           Having shorter days and longer nights during fall and winter can disrupt a 24-hour clock inside our bodies called the circadian rhythm. This clock regulates multiple bodily processes and is influenced by the day-night cycle, said circadian rhythm expert Joseph Takahashi, professor and chair of the neuroscience department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, via email. Disrupted circadian responses may affect brain regions involved in mood, along with causing fatigue and low energy from lack of sleep.           Taking care of your health is key to dealing with seasonal affective disorder. Here’s what experts say you can do to manage seasonal affective disorder. Remember to talk to your medical provider before starting any new treatments.     Light therapy is the go-to treatment for seasonal affective disorder. It involves exposing yourself to a light box with at least 10,000 lux for at least 30 minutes. (Lux is a unit of measurement for light level intensity.)           “A bright sunny day is 50,000 to 100,000 lux,” said Dr. Jason Tucciarone, an instructor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. While you can purchase a light box of lower intensity, you will have to spend more time sitting in front of it.     How red light can affect your sleep         There are two ways a light box helps with seasonal affective disorder. First, mimicking outdoor light corrects the internal clock thrown out of sync from shorter days in winter. Another way is by increasing levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in balancing mood.           You can use the light box at any time, but morning use can give you more energy for the rest of the day. “Look away from it and do something where you’re sitting in front of the light, whether it’s eating breakfast, reading the news or anything that will keep you busy for 30 minutes,” Tucciarone said. Make sure to stay 2 to 3 feet away from it and do not look directly into the box because 10,000 lux can hurt your eyes.           These type of alarm clocks imitate natural sunlight. When it’s time to wake up, the light gradually increases in intensity.           Some research suggests dawn simulators may be just as effective in reducing depressive symptoms. They may be a good addition to your light box therapy, Tucciarone said, as you can get exposed to light the moment you wake up without straining your eyes.           Thomas Kilkenny, a sleep specialist at Northwell Health in New York, emphasized the importance of getting enough sleep. The lack of sunlight from shorter winter days can disrupt our internal clocks that tell us when it’s time to be awake and when it’s time to wind down. The disrupted sleep schedule can cause insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness.     Sleep this way to add almost 5 years to your life         Get ready for bed an hour before you plan to go, Kilkenny recommended. Dim the lights, use the bathroom and avoid arguments or emotional situations where you’re going to get yourself worked up. Additionally, avoid using electronics as you start to wind down as they can make it harder to fall asleep.           “Phones and computers have bright light which can trick your mind into thinking it’s daylight,” Tucciarone said.           Finally, he advised having a stable sleep schedule, which entails going to bed around the same time every night and waking up the same time every morning.     These common walking mistakes can ruin a good thing         Exercise works as a mood booster as it releases chemicals such as serotonin and endorphins to make you feel good and cope better with stress. Even a low-impact activity such as a 10-to-15 minute brisk walk can improve depressive symptoms.           Going outside for a small walk can be even more beneficial, Kilkenny said, since you are simultaneously exposing yourself to bright light.           If you are going to exercise, Kilkenny recommended doing it in the morning rather than at night. “Working out a couple of hours before bed will actually raise your body temperature, which is a bad idea,” he said.     Sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer appointed New York state’s first loneliness ambassador         Feeling an urge to hibernate for the winter? Social isolation is common among people with seasonal affective disorder, and isolating may contribute to depressive symptoms. Recently, the US surgeon general reported that being socially disconnected was as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.           “Socialization is really important in treating disorders in general,” Tucciarone said. “Isolating is not good for mood.” You may not feel up to a party or a dinner date, but even small amounts of companionship can make a difference. One suggestion from Tucciarone is having a buddy with you when taking outdoor walks.           Cognitive behavioral therapy has people with seasonal affective disorder work to develop an awareness on what they’re experiencing, identify negative thoughts and come up with strategies to replace the thoughts with more positive ones, said Lucian Manu, a psychiatrist at Stony Brook Medicine in New York.     Is exercise or medication better for depression? Experts weigh in         Cognitive behavioral therapy may be more effective than light therapy at preventing remissions. One study found that six weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy helped reduce depressive symptoms and reduced the chances of developing seasonal affective disorder the following winter.           Antidepressants are another option that Manu recommended for people with severe seasonal affective disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for example, work to boost serotonin levels, which can help boost mood. A popular prescription is bupropion, which Manu said helps in managing increasing sleep (along with appetite and weight) for people with seasonal affective disorder.

health,"Cutting 1 teaspoon of salt works as well as blood pressure meds, study finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/11/health/low-salt-diet-or-medication-wellness/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.         Cutting 1 teaspoon of salt from your diet each day can lower your top blood pressure reading just as much as a typical hypertension medication, even if you don’t have high blood pressure, a new study found.           A teaspoon of salt is 2,300 milligrams — that’s the top daily limit for people over 14 recommended by the latest US nutritional guidelines. However, the American Heart Association recommends a diet with less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day.     ‘Massive efforts’ are needed to reduce salt intake and protect lives, World Health Organization says         “This is the first study to show that people who are already on blood pressure medication can lower their blood pressure even more by limiting sodium,” said coprincipal investigator Norrina Allen, professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.           “And regardless of medication, we found 70% to 75% of people are likely to see a reduction in their blood pressure if they lower the sodium in their diet,” Allen said.           High blood pressure is often called the “silent killer,” because there are no symptoms — the only way to know if you have it is to test for it. Yet hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults worldwide and can lead to heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and stroke, according to a 2023 report by the World Health Organization.           Nearly half of all Americans live with high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association. About a third of those have “resistant” hypertension, high blood pressure that has not responded despite the concurrent use of three types of medications. A 2021 study found men ages 20 to 49 are up to 70% more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension than women of the same age.           “Most people today eat way too much salt because it’s added into nearly everything we eat,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.           “A teaspoon of salt may seem like a small amount. However, that added salt seems to have an effect on blood pressure that is surprisingly large,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.           The study, published Saturday in the journal JAMA, assigned 213 people ages 50 to 75 to one week of a high- or low-sodium diet. After eating that diet for seven days, each person then switched to the alternate diet.           About 25% of the participants had normal blood pressure, while another 25% had untreated hypertension. Of the remaining group, 20% had blood pressure under control, while 31% did not.           During the high-salt week, people ate their normal diet, along with two bouillon packets, each containing 1,100 milligrams of sodium. During the low-salt week, people ate foods with low sodium, purchased and given to them by dietitians. The goal was only 500 milligrams of salt a day, a dramatic drop.           The drop in blood pressure while on the low-sodium diet was quick and dramatic, according to the study. Compared to the high-sodium diet, blood pressure on the extremely low-salt diet dropped 8 millimeters of mercury.     This diet with exercise reduces dangerous belly fat and more, study says         “Compared to their normal diet, people reduced their blood pressure by about 6 millimeters of mercury, about the same effect you’d see for a first-line blood pressure medication,” Allen said.           “In addition, that drop happened pretty quickly and was consistent for people with normal blood pressure, slightly high blood pressure or those already on medications.”           Cutting this amount of salt didn’t have any significant side effects, Allen said, unless you count adjusting to a blander diet.           “When you go from a high-salt diet to a low-salt diet, everything tastes bland,” she said. “I want to encourage people to stick with it because your taste buds do adjust within a couple of weeks or so, and you really do get taste and flavor back and normal things will taste very salty.           “Taste bud adjustment takes a little bit longer, but the blood pressure improvements are pretty quick,” she added.           Blood pressure medications, however, can have many side effects, including cough, constipation or diarrhea, dizziness, lack of energy, headache, muscle pain, nausea, nervousness, fatigue, weight gain or loss, and erection issues. Typically, these ease over time, according to the National Library of Medicine.           Putting down the saltshaker is a good start, “but that’s not where most people get their salt,” Freeman said.           “It’s in foods you’d not expect to have a lot of salt: A couple of slices of bread could have 400 or 500 milligrams of salt; a pickle has a full day’s worth of salt; and a bowl of soup could have several days’ worth of salt in it,” he said.     Salt warnings are coming to NYC menus         But careful shopping can accomplish the task, Allen said. Dietitians purchased the low-sodium diets provided in the study after reading labels at local grocery stores, Allen said.           CNN looked at the low-salt menu and found most breakfasts included store-bought quick oats, Greek yogurt and grapes, while lunch featured grilled chicken, lettuces dressed with oil and vinegar, and low-salt versions of lentil soup, breads, peanut butter and tortilla chips. Dinners included ready-to-eat brown rice and veggies, burritos and lasagna.           “They were the low-salt versions of vegetable lasagna,” Allen said. “They were apples and bananas and things everyone could get at the grocery store. They were not specially prepared by a chef.”           The award-winning DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is an expert-approved method of lowering salt intake. DASH has a simple premise: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods; limit foods high in saturated fat; and limit your sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams a day, just as this study did.     How to build a habit in 5 steps, according to science         The DASH meal plan includes four to six servings of vegetables and another four to six servings of fruit, three servings of whole-grain products, two to four servings of fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and several servings each of lean meats and nuts, seeds and legumes each day.           Regardless of which diet plan chosen, those who want to cut salt are better off making their own foods at home, where they can read labels and calculate sodium levels, Freeman said.           Eating at a restaurant, even if it’s healthy, could be troublesome.           “Take a vegetable dish at a restaurant: Those green beans may have been prepared with salted butter with salted crispy onions or whatever on top. Before long you’ve had a huge salt load that was never intended,” Freeman said. “The best way to eat is to eat as unprocessed as possible.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

health,Opinion: Here’s one more reason to stop shaming parents,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/11/opinions/sleep-social-media-influencers-parenting-alaimo-wellness/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: Kara Alaimo, an associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University, writes about issues affecting women and social media. Her book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls — And How We Can Take It Back” will be published by Alcove Press on March 5, 2024. Follow her on Instagram, Facebook and X. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.         For years, experts and self-anointed experts like momfluencers have been telling parents like me that following certain practices would get our kids to put themselves to sleep and sleep through the night. Now, a new study suggests the reason some kids don’t sleep well is because they’re genetically predisposed to insomnia — not because their moms can’t get sleep training right. I hope these findings will prompt our society to radically rethink the way parents — but, let’s face it, especially mothers — are instructed, judged and shamed for our parenting practices.           The new research, published Wednesday in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, finds that children who have genetic predispositions for insomnia are more likely to have trouble falling asleep and tend to wake up more throughout the night.           This makes perfect sense to me because, as a baby, my first child was a terrible sleeper. For the first several years of her life, it took her an incredibly long time to fall asleep, and she woke up regularly all night long. Reading this study, I have to wonder if maybe the reason was genetic.           Of course, as a new mom, I was asked by everyone — pediatricians, family members, fellow mamas, strangers I passed on the sidewalk — how my baby was sleeping, and when I said it wasn’t going well, I almost always got the same answer: I needed to try harder to sleep train her. The problem, most people seemed to assume, was that I wasn’t tough enough to let her cry it out for a few nights until she got the hang of things.           Sleep training — or letting a baby cry until they learn how to sleep — feels like the predominant advice given to parents these days, though there are also plenty of people who will shame parents for doing so (of course). I tried this method with my first child. It didn’t work. This new study suggests it’s possible that it wasn’t my parenting after all — maybe my kid’s genetics just make it difficult for her to sleep.     Opinion: You might want to rethink taking melatonin as a sleep aid         There’s a bigger lesson here that goes far beyond what parents should be taught about getting kids to sleep. It’s that there isn’t a right way to parent all kids because every one is different. So, when we see a momfluencer share a TikTok with the tips that help her get her kid magically to sleep, what she’s sharing is what works for her child in the context of her family’s circumstances. That’s often quite different from what will work for others.           Yet so many moms are left feeling like they can’t cut it if other people’s recipes don’t work for them. As I argue in my forthcoming book “Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls and How We Can Take It Back,” all this advice targeted at moms on social media can help explain why, as the use of social networks exploded from 2000-2015, the rate of postpartum depression among women who gave birth in hospitals rose by a rate of seven, according to a 2019 study.           I don’t want to judge momfluencers too harshly here. Amy Tuteur, an obstetrician I interviewed for my book, pointed out that many moms who share their tips online are doing so because it’s one of the only ways moms can get validation in our society. “There’s a lot of doubt involved in parenting,” she told me. “You never know if you’re doing it the right way, and it’s not like your child is helping you. Your child isn’t saying, ‘Thank you for sending me to time out and helping me learn about delayed gratification.’ No, they’re lying there on the floor screaming at you.”             But, when we see these posts, we should take them for what they are: advice that worked for one family. If it’s helpful (and safe), take it — but if it doesn’t work given the (likely very different) characteristics of our own kid and life, it doesn’t mean we’ve failed. It just means we’re different!           Our society, too, should stop preaching what works for some people as universal gospel. The study released this week reminds us that when a kid struggles, it’s often not their parent’s fault. So, it would be a good idea for everyone to think twice before pushing their parenting strategies on others — and perhaps, instead, acknowledge how very hard parenting can be. Not having to deal with these kinds of messages of failure would at least give parents one less thing to lose sleep over.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

health,Justin Paget/Digital Vision/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/15/health/who-loneliness-social-connection/index.html,"       The World Health Organization is making loneliness a global health priority, it said Wednesday, launching a new Commission on Social Connection.           For the next three years, the commission will focus on ways to address the “pressing health threat” of a global epidemic of loneliness, reviewing the latest science and designing strategies to help people deepen their social connections. It’s co-chaired by African Union Youth Envoy Chido Mpemba and US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has written and spoken extensively about the risks of social isolation and has made the issue one of his top concerns while in office.           Murthy said it is an “underappreciated” threat to health that has now become widespread.           “For too long, loneliness has existed behind the shadows, unseen and underappreciated, driving mental and physical illness,” he said. “Now, we have an opportunity to change that.”     Lack of certain types of social connection linked with higher risk of dying early, study finds         Committee member Dr. Karen DeSalvo, the chief health officer at Google, said that when she was a clinician and when she was health commissioner of New Orleans, she learned firsthand that “great care matters, but it has to happen in a context” – and that includes social connection.           Knocking on doors in New Orleans after a hurricane took out power and left homes swelteringly hot, she and colleagues tried to get people to go to shelters, but it was difficult to get some to leave, even when so many were so alone.           “People can easily get in the margins and get isolated, and it affects their health outcomes,” DeSalvo said.           Someone may seek help for chest pain, for example, and the health care system will focus on treating that pain, but it’s difficult for them to actually get better if they are discharged into social isolation, she said.           Loneliness has drawn a lot of attention recently in the public health sector. Last week, New York state appointed sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer as its first loneliness ambassador. In May, Murthy laid out a framework to tackle loneliness and “mend the fabric of our nation.” And it’s not just a US phenomenon; in 2018, the UK appointed its first minister for loneliness.   Sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer appointed New York state’s first loneliness ambassador   Research shows that a lack of certain types of social connection is linked with poor mental health and increases the risk of anxiety, depression and suicide.          “Social disconnection has now become a key driver of the broader mental health crisis that we are seeing in this world,” Murthy said. Roughly a billion people – 1 in 8  – are living with a mental health problem, a quarter of them adolescents, he said.           Loneliness and social isolation can also lead to poor physical health. People who lack social connection face a higher risk of dying early. Loneliness and social isolation have long been associated with poor immune function and cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure, and they increase the risk of stroke by 30%. They also contribute to cognitive decline and are associated with a 50% increase in dementia. People who are isolated also tend to have more unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking to excess and being more sedentary.           The health impact of loneliness is so far-reaching that one study compared it to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.           A lot of research on social isolation and loneliness focuses on seniors. Older adults are at higher risk because they more often live on their own, have lost more family or friends and are more likely to have physical problems like hearing loss, which can cut them off from being social, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.         But it’s not just older people who are lonely.           A survey taken across 142 countries published last month said that nearly 1 in 4 adults reported feeling very or fairly lonely. Children are also not immune; some studies have found that over half of children and adolescents felt lonely at least some of the time.           The Covid-19 pandemic may have exacerbated those feelings, studies show, with social isolation and loneliness negatively affecting younger people’s depression and anxiety symptoms.           While humans are social creatures by nature, people get better at socializing with practice, says Dr. Ryan Patel, a psychiatrist at The Ohio State University Office of Student Life Counseling and Consultation Services who also studies social connectedness.           The pandemic’s isolation limited the number of “softer, easy social interactions” that people normally have, and the impact is still felt, especially among young people.           “When you take that away, it can then be anxiety-provoking to be in highly social environments when you’ve not had that kind of practice,” said Patel, who is not a part of the WHO committee.           Patel said younger people’s hyperconnectivity has also inadvertently narrowed the lens with which they see the world, so when they interact with others who may not share their perspective, it can be challenging.           “You might be worried that you might say the wrong thing, and that can heighten anxiety,” Patel said. The polarized environment also disincentivizes people to interact, and that too can result in loneliness and isolation.     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           “Social cohesion, connectedness, loneliness matters for healthy outcomes for people of all ages, wherever they are,” DeSalvo said. She hopes the new WHO commission will provide evidence to help health systems around the world understand how to better address the connection between loneliness and poor health outcomes like heart disease.           “They’ve got a clear track record, and I think what they can bring to this is an action orientation,” she said.           In addition to finding ways to help people learn how to help themselves, their neighbors and their communities feel less isolated, the committee can help the broader community tackle this major public health problem.           “So how do we help the public and private sector around the world know what they can do to take these interventions to understand how we can move forward to improve the health of people everywhere?” DeSalvo said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Maria Sturm,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/style/lumbee-you-dont-look-native-maria-sturm-hyphenated-cec/index.html," Editor’s Note: This feature is part of CNN Style’s series Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.         The people of Pembroke, North Carolina, don’t shy away from their Native identity.           In fact, some of them wear it on their sleeves — be it a feather-patterned blanket draped around the shoulders or a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Native Pride.”           These kinds of markers are everywhere in Pembroke, the tribal seat of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, and surrounding Robeson County, photographer Maria Sturm said. But when members of this 55,000-strong tribe venture outside their tight-knit community, they’re often told they don’t “look” Native.           That tension is at the heart of Sturm’s latest photography book “You Don’t Look Native To Me.”           Through tender portraits of young Lumbee people, combined with snippets of interview transcripts and historical text, Sturm explores what makes someone Native American. Is it race, tribal citizenship or a community you’re a part of? Who gets to decide? And what do you do when outsiders — the US government and even other tribes — don’t see you the way you see yourselves?           “It is more the way you carry yourself, and it doesn’t really matter the shade that you have,” Sturm said in a Zoom interview. “The shade that you have matters in an outside world more than it mattered in that microcosm of Robeson County.”           Questions of identity and belonging loom large for the Lumbee, the most populous tribe east of the Mississippi River.           Though the state of North Carolina recognized the tribe in 1885 and Congress in 1956 acknowledged the Lumbee as American Indians, the federal government also denied them the rights and funding afforded to other federally recognized tribes. To this day, the Lumbee tribe continues to fight for full federal recognition.           The tribe’s in-between status is a product of its history. The Lumbee have roots in various Sioux, Algonquin and Iroquois-speaking nations who migrated to modern-day Robeson County after fleeing disease, the slave trade and warfare brought on by European colonization, as historian Malinda Maynor Lowery documents in “The Lumbee Indians: An American Struggle.” Some of the Natives eventually intermarried with English-speaking settlers, as well as enslaved and free African Americans, resulting in a mixed population with a wide array of physical features.           Descendants of these groups make up the community now known as the Lumbee. Even as their culture and traditions evolved over time, and as others question their status as American Indians, the Lumbee maintained an identity as Native people.           And as Sturm captures in her photos, many young Lumbee are figuring out for themselves what that identity and culture looks like.           Sturm, who is Romanian and grew up in Germany, started photographing the Lumbee in 2011.           The project was born out of a conversation with her stepfather, who told her about his friend Jay Hansford C. Vest — a member of the Monacan Indian Nation, which at the time was unrecognized by the federal government.           Sturm kept stumbling over the word “unrecognized.” She couldn’t wrap her head around the concept: How could a non-Native entity determine whether a tribe was Native American or not? What did that even mean?           Sturm said her stepfather also mentioned that Vest had blue eyes and blond hair — a detail that prompted her to confront her own internalized notions and stereotypes about Native Americans.           “In that moment, I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I have never met a Native American person in my life. Why can he not be blond and have blue eyes?’” she said.           Sturm visited Vest at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, where he was teaching at the time, and sat in on his classes. Thinking she would explore the issue of unrecognized tribes, she asked Vest’s students if anyone might be able to take her around their community.           That’s when she encountered Jonathan Jacobs, a Lumbee man whose musings about Lumbee culture and identity are featured prominently through the book. Through Jacobs, Sturm said she was introduced to other Lumbee and the project grew from there.           Over the course of several visits between 2011 and 2017, Sturm documented the lives of the Lumbee, gravitating toward how young people understood their identity and how they chose to telegraph that to the world.           “With the rise of social media, there was a new way of being proud of identifying yourself as Native American whereas before it wasn’t always possible,” Sturm said.           As Sturm observed, that identity is signaled, in part, through the heavily present Native symbolism. Pembroke “screams of Native American things,” she added. It’s in the roads named “Lumbee Street” and “Dreamcatcher Drive,” in the dreamcatchers hanging on the walls of homes, on cars and in tattoos. In these symbols, Sturm picked up on an implicit message.           “For me, it’s a little bit like, ‘Don’t ask me. Maybe I don’t look that way, but it’s clear. We don’t have to have this discussion,’” Sturm said.           Some might even perceive it as stereotypical — in one photo, a Lumbee man named Scottie wears a Washington Redskins jacket containing a logo that is now widely considered offensive. When Sturm asked him about it, she said he told her “this is who I am.”           “It shows that you know you are something. And because everything is stripped away … you have just these little bits and pieces that you can hold onto,” Sturm said. “I thought it’s pretty impressive that the symbols that a person like Scottie holds onto are not even original, but in a way they give him so much pride and confidence.”           Throughout the book, Sturm’s subjects reflect on their personal struggles around their identity.           Kayla tells Strum about how her grandmother raised her as Lumbee, but at the same time didn’t take her to powwows and discouraged her from speaking the Lumbee dialect. As a result, she was picked on for “talking like a White girl” at home, yet is considered a “country bumpkin” when she goes elsewhere.           Jacobs, meanwhile, pushes back on the idea that the Lumbee even need federal recognition. Even though certain aspects of their culture have been lost or changed over time, he knows he is Lumbee, as do others in the community. For him, it’s all that matters.           “I’m like a billion percent sure we will never know what Lumbee language was. I’m a billion percent sure we will never know really where we came from. But that does not mean we are not Indian,” Jacobs says in the book.           It’s this sense of self-determination that has stuck with Sturm. She hopes the project will resonate with anyone who has ever had their identity questioned.           “I hope at least that many people can relate to this feeling of wanting or belonging to something, but other people are not able to see that about you,” Sturm said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

Sturm said her stepfather also mentioned that Vest had blue eyes and blond hair — a detail that prompted her to confront her own internalized notions and stereotypes about Native Americans.           “In that moment, I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I have never met a Native American person in my life. Why can he not be blond and have blue eyes?’” she said.           Sturm visited Vest at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, where he was teaching at the time, and sat in on his classes. Thinking she would explore the issue of unrecognized tribes, she asked Vest’s students if anyone might be able to take her around their community.           That’s when she encountered Jonathan Jacobs, a Lumbee man whose musings about Lumbee culture and identity are featured prominently through the book. Through Jacobs, Sturm said she was introduced to other Lumbee and the project grew from there.           Over the course of several visits between 2011 and 2017, Sturm documented the lives of the Lumbee, gravitating toward how young people understood their identity and how they chose to telegraph that to the world.           “With the rise of social media, there was a new way of being proud of identifying yourself as Native American whereas before it wasn’t always possible,” Sturm said.           As Sturm observed, that identity is signaled, in part, through the heavily present Native symbolism. Pembroke “screams of Native American things,” she added. It’s in the roads named “Lumbee Street” and “Dreamcatcher Drive,” in the dreamcatchers hanging on the walls of homes, on cars and in tattoos. In these symbols, Sturm picked up on an implicit message.           “For me, it’s a little bit like, ‘Don’t ask me. Maybe I don’t look that way, but it’s clear. We don’t have to have this discussion,’” Sturm said.           Some might even perceive it as stereotypical — in one photo, a Lumbee man named Scottie wears a Washington Redskins jacket containing a logo that is now widely considered offensive. When Sturm asked him about it, she said he told her “this is who I am.”           “It shows that you know you are something. And because everything is stripped away … you have just these little bits and pieces that you can hold onto,” Sturm said. “I thought it’s pretty impressive that the symbols that a person like Scottie holds onto are not even original, but in a way they give him so much pride and confidence.”           Throughout the book, Sturm’s subjects reflect on their personal struggles around their identity.           Kayla tells Strum about how her grandmother raised her as Lumbee, but at the same time didn’t take her to powwows and discouraged her from speaking the Lumbee dialect. As a result, she was picked on for “talking like a White girl” at home, yet is considered a “country bumpkin” when she goes elsewhere.           Jacobs, meanwhile, pushes back on the idea that the Lumbee even need federal recognition. Even though certain aspects of their culture have been lost or changed over time, he knows he is Lumbee, as do others in the community. For him, it’s all that matters.           “I’m like a billion percent sure we will never know what Lumbee language was. I’m a billion percent sure we will never know really where we came from. But that does not mean we are not Indian,” Jacobs says in the book.           It’s this sense of self-determination that has stuck with Sturm. She hopes the project will resonate with anyone who has ever had their identity questioned.           “I hope at least that many people can relate to this feeling of wanting or belonging to something, but other people are not able to see that about you,” Sturm said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Capturing the wild days of early-2000s indie rock,https://edition.cnn.com/style/2000s-indie-rock-indie-seen-book/index.html,"       If you were a teen at the turn of the millennium, chances are your musical taste fell into one of two camps: You were either a pop kid, with the likes of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, *NSYNC or Destiny’s Child on your Sony Discman, or you were a “new indie rock” kid with posters of Pete Doherty or The Strokes’ Julian Casablancas on your bedroom walls.           The latter genre was loosely defined. Indie rock acts ranged in style and sound. The Libertines, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Modest Mouse and Amy Winehouse might all be considered part of the movement, albeit in very different ways. What they shared, though, was an aura of cool — one that Los Angeles-based photographer Piper Ferguson spent much of her early career capturing.           Ferguson’s debut book “Indie, Seen” offers a raw and nostalgic look at the early-2000s, with behind-the-scenes portraits depicting artists from Interpol to Kasabian, Peaches to PJ Harvey. Together they form what she described as “a collection of ‘moments’ that really capture what indie was all about back then.”           “I have so much footage from those days,” she said over Zoom. “To me, it was such a fantastic, creative era for the music industry.”           Comprising some 350 images, many of which spent years languishing in filing cabinets, “Indie, Seen” features live shots and party pictures, candid snapshots and editorial portraits, all shot using film. Many were taken at Ferguson’s own LA club Cafe Bleu, which she opened with best friend Shalyce Benfell in the late 1990s, while later pictures were captured as she traveled the world to photograph festivals for magazines.           “I have always been into music — so much so that I originally wanted to direct music videos. Photography didn’t really seem like a career option. Then I bought a small Pentax (camera) and began shooting all the bands that played at Cafe Bleu,” Ferguson said, explaining that she learned her craft from photography books purchased at a yard sale. “I started taking the camera with me everywhere I went, just snapping gigs, the crowds, the backstage. And I fell in love with it.”     In photos: The queer ‘renegades’ who built community in 1990s San Francisco         In 1999, Ferguson had a picture — a close-up shot of Rage Against the Machine performing at the very first edition of Coachella — published in a major music publication, Spin, for the first time. More magazine work, from features to covers, followed. Over the next decade, she established herself as a respected name in the indie circuit and, at the time, one of its very few female photographers.           “It was obviously a bit different being a woman in a very male-dominated field,” Ferguson said. “But overall, there were way more people who were supportive than weren’t. I think that’s one of the things that made the indie movement particularly great: There was a collective sense of wanting to do something really cool and help others doing the same. I was treated like a peer, an equal. Everybody was just striving to make something good.”           This camaraderie is evident throughout “Indie, Seen,” which sees Ferguson weave together photos with personal, first-hand accounts and vignettes of her experience shooting them.           There’s Joe Strummer of The Clash telling her “You can’t rush art, baby” as she apologizes for a shoot taking too long (“one of the greatest moments of my career,” Ferguson said of the playful comment); The Verve front man Richard Ashcroft driving her through a London park in search of the perfect backdrop for a picture; and The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr (who wrote the foreword to her book) becoming a good friend of hers after working on several shoots together.           “Mostly, everyone was just really laidback and fun,” Ferguson said. “And a bit wild, of course.”           Sections of the book are dedicated to episodes that felt like particularly meaningful cultural moments — The Strokes playing at West Hollywood’s Troubadour in 2001, the year the band’s debut album “Is This It” sealed indie rock as the next chapter of rock ‘n’ roll; or Coldplay performing at LA’s Chateau Marmont in 2002 shortly after the release of “A Rush of Blood to the Head.”           “I realized I was witnessing history and tried to take in each and every shoot,” she said.     How Afrobeats conquered the world: One photographer documents the rise of a musical phenomenon         Ferguson also delves into quieter moments with seminal bands like The Killers, Pavement, Interpol and The Libertines. While she said all the shoots felt special, her favorites include a raw on-stage image of the late Amy Winehouse putting on a ballet slipper while balancing on the other foot.           “She looked so nervous and was shaking, as if she had no idea why the crowd was going crazy for her,” Ferguson recalled, adding that the late singer looked “so vulnerable.”           Then there’s the photo of Beck in a bright green jumper and floral tie, umbrella in hand, looking directly down Ferguson’s lens outside a taco joint in Hollywood. The image, from a Mojo magazine shoot marking the release of his 2005 album “Guero,” graces the cover of Ferguson’s book.           “He’s the coolest, most down-to-earth creative kid in town,” she said, “and the epitome of indie rock.”           As well as capturing era-defining bands, “Indie, Seen” spotlights some of the 2000s’ lesser-known — but nonetheless influential — bands like The Datsuns, Foxygen and The Bangs. For Ferguson, illustrating the breadth of the movement was key to curating the book.           “When I think of indie music from the early aughts, I think of something inherently different, artistic and creative,” she said. “So many bands were part of that, and I thought it was important to show them all. The scene was so wide-ranging.”           This might be one of the reasons why the genre thrived in the 2000s, despite being considered “alternative.” Eschewing strict categorizations, indie rock ranged from the catchy and high-energy tunes of The Cribs to the deeply intimate and introspective songs of Cat Power, from Death Cab for Cutie’s atmospheric albums to the folksy vibes of Iron & Wine, all artists Ferguson had the opportunity to photograph. Indie music had what Ferguson called an “almost DIY approach” that, she noted, made it feel authentic and open to experimentation.           The genre became the decade’s soundtrack for a generation of millennials – and some Gen X-ers, too. Still, Ferguson hopes the appeal of “Indie, Seen” extends beyond those who grew up in the 2000s.     Behind the scenes of Tupac’s iconic photoshoot         “I’d love for younger generations to pick up the book and go, ‘Let me go find this or that band on Spotify,’” she said. “Indie rock marks a pretty influential period of our music history, so I’d really like for it to continue to reverberate. I want ‘Indie, Seen’ to be a celebration. An invitation to be inspired by those cool kids from back then. Try things. Don’t be afraid. Get out there. That’s the indie spirit.”     “Indie, Seen,” published by Insight Editions, is available now.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

style,Is this Banksy’s real name? Resurfaced interview suggests it could be,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/style/banksy-real-name-resurfaced-interview-intl-scli/index.html,"       Anonymity lies at the center of the mythology surrounding the elusive street artist Banksy, but he may have revealed his name in a resurfaced interview.           First recorded in 2003, the interview was released Tuesday as a bonus episode of the BBC podcast series “The Banksy Story.”         When former BBC arts correspondent Nigel Wrench asked Banksy whether his name was “Robert Banks,” as The Independent newspaper had reported at the time, the artist responded: “It’s Robbie.”           Wrench shared the archival interview with podcast host James Peak, a self-confessed “super fan” of Banksy’s work, after hearing the 10-episode series that had charted the artist’s rise and included an unverified recording of his voice from a recovered 2005 interview with US National Public Radio (NPR).           However, all might not be as it seems, as is so often the case with Banksy – an artist known for his satirical humor, subversive methods and anti-authority themes.           “A name comes out,” Peak told CNN Tuesday. “Is it the right name? Is it a clever joke?” Peak added, alluding to the fact that a name like Robbie Banks could be a good pun.           Shielded by his anonymity, Banksy’s distinctive graffiti art has popped up around the world, appearing on the walls of bombed buildings in Ukraine, on T-shirts to support protesters facing trial for toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston during 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in England, and in Paris, highlighting Europe’s migrant crisis in 2018.           His 2003 show, which opened shortly after his interview with Wrench, featured graffitied police vans, an image of Winston Churchill with a grass Mohican and live farm animals painted with the Metropolitan Police’s blue-checked patterns.           Banksy talks about these political themes within his work with Wrench, revealing the “kernel” of his early ideas before he became a global icon, as he considered the merits of using graffiti as a means to produce art, Peak said.           “If you are a guy making art that sells for ridiculous sums of money and you have this… administration around you, I have often wondered how pure you can be in your intention and art,” Peak added.           “And what strikes me listening to this interview is all that is present and correct… it’s almost like he’s made up his mind about… what his art is for and the means of engagement for it.”           Despite these political themes that have marked his work from early on, Banksy told Wrench in 2003 that he didn’t consider himself to be “that political.”           He added: “If you think about anything about your life for longer than a second, then you have to work out that the shoes you wear are made by somebody on a pathetic amount of money and the coffee you drink means somebody, somewhere in the world is getting done over.”     Is this what Banksy sounds like? Old interview may hold the key         Speaking about vandalism and his approach to art, Banksy said: “[Vandalism] is a quicker way of making your point.”           “For me, the golden aim really is… it takes you less time to make it than it takes for people to look at it,” he added.           Asked whether his exhibition was about anarchism, Banksy told Wrench: “I’m interested in injustice. Who has the right to judge anybody else? If you’ve ever fallen foul of the justice system then it turns you very skeptical about everything, so I guess I like to turn it on its head a little bit… I’m into working out who really is the good guys.”           Listening to the archival interview has only increased his admiration of Banksy, Peak said, an admiration that grew from realizing the artistic “brilliance” but also the “warm and human and kind and progressive and liberal… sentiments” underpinning it.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Auguste Toulmouche/From Wikipedia,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/19/style/the-hesitant-fiancee-tiktok-eye-roll-cec/index.html,"       Behold, a woman fuming.           Though she’s dressed in an opulent, fur-trimmed gown in a palatial French home sometime in the mid-19th century, her silent fury is recognizable to women the world over who’ve contained their ire to an eye roll.           She’s “The Hesitant Fiancée,” the eponymous subject of the painter Auguste Toulmouche’s 1866 painting. The realist work, which had been overshadowed in art history by the arrival of French Impressionist painters soon after, is being reappraised more than 150 years later by art buffs on TikTok.           She’s inspired scores of interpretations from users who imagine the undoubtedly irritated thoughts going through her mind when she was painted — “you’d look so much prettier with a smile on your face” — becoming something of a meme template. She’s appreciated by women who share her disillusionment with confining gender roles. And she’s inviting feminist reassessments of the painting itself.           When “The Hesitant Fiancée” was first exhibited, works depicting the quiet indignation of women were sometimes seen as unserious, and much of the popular art at the time satirized single women, said Kathryn Brown, associate professor of art history and visual culture at Loughborough University in the UK.           But seen through contemporary eyes, “The Hesitant Fiancée” shows women in solidarity, supporting each other in “negotiating oppressive systems,” noted Brown, who wrote about Toulmouche’s work in the monograph “Women Readers in French Painting 1870–1890.”           “Over a century and a half later, perhaps we’re still discovering the full political significance of that kind of unity,” she said in an email.           Toulmouche painted scenes of elegant, wealthy French women in domestic settings, often chronicling their romantic exploits. The women in his paintings were, on the surface, little more than sumptuously dressed debutantes — the French novelist Émile Zola in 1874 called Toulmouche’s subjects “delicious dolls,” Brown said.           Toulmouche’s paintings were successful in their day partly because of the “fantasy of female life” they depicted: The women in his works are wives, mothers, sisters and daughters who don’t stray from their roles in the domestic sphere, Brown said.           “The Hesitant Fiancée,” also translated to “The Reluctant Bride,” was originally exhibited under the title “Un mariage de raison,” or “A Marriage of Convenience” at the Académie des Beaux-Arts’ Paris Salon in 1866, Brown said. Toulmouche’s work was popular for a time, with his paintings often recreated as etchings in newspapers, Brown noted. But he was eventually overshadowed by Impressionist painters like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas, she said.           While Toulmouche was “by no means a painter of feminist art,” Brown said, the women in his paintings are interpreted today as slyly subversive.           In the 1865 painting “Forbidden Fruit,” three young women excitedly pore over books in a library while a fourth appears to guard the door. They’ve snuck into this room searching for information — “undoubtedly about sex,” Brown added, based on their wry smiles — that’s been kept from them.           Brown suggests that the four women in “Forbidden Fruit” reappear in “The Hesitant Fiancée,” now supporting one of their own in her unhappy slog toward the altar.           “One of the four young women from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ is now about to be married, perhaps to the ‘wrong’ person or because she doesn’t want to marry at all,” Brown said. “Read as a narrative that unfolds across the two works, it looks like the young woman from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ knows what’s about to happen to her.”           The revival of “The Hesitant Fiancée” has been centuries in the making. Popular art accounts on TikTok started posting about it over the last few weeks, discovering it with glee, though at least one user, art enthusiast Kira (@TheArtRevival), shared a video about Toulmouche in February. She said in an email that she’s long loved his work.           “One of my favorite subjects in art is fancy ladies lounging around, living life with apathy,” she said. “Few can relate to their lives but nearly all can relate to their disdain.”           The popular user Tatyana About Art said that “The Hesitant Fiancée” is really a tragedy. The subject of the painting is likely depicted moments away from — or moments after — marrying the husband she’s less than in love with. She’s flanked by two women who gently attempt to comfort her while another plays with a flower crown in the mirror, perhaps dreaming of her own wedding day.           “The bride is completely alone in her sentiment of doom and unwillingness,” art historian Tatyana said in a video about “The Hesitant Fiancée.”           Today, though, some TikTok-ers view the titular fiancée as a rebel, not entering quietly into a marriage she’s unhappy about. Some users have theorized that she may not have been attracted to men at all, and since homosexuality was still viewed as immoral in 19th-century France, living openly would’ve been near-impossible at the time.           While we may never know the full story of the woman skulking in the armchair, her fed-up mien is familiar to anyone who’s ever had to swallow their anger. She’s trapped, said Kira, and “we’ve all been there.” That she’s expressing it within the confines of her rigid societal role is still captivating over a century later.           “I see her and think, ‘Yes babe, roll those eyes,’” Kira said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Russian artist receives seven-year sentence for anti-war protest,https://edition.cnn.com/style/alexandra-skochilenko-jail-art-protest-russia-ukraine-war/index.html,"       Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko, who had replaced price tags with anti-war messages in a St. Petersburg grocery store as an act of protest, was sentenced to seven years in jail by a court in the Russian city on Thursday.           According to the court’s press service, Skochilenko was found guilty of “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.”           The prosecution claimed that in March last year, Skochilenko “placed paper fragments containing deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in places for attaching commodity price tags” in a chain supermarket in St. Petersburg.           Despite Skochilenko pleading not guilty to the charge and the defense seeking acquittal, the court imposed a seven-year sentence with a three-year ban on activities related to using “electronic or information and telecommunication networks,” the press service said in a Telegram post.     Major museums around the world are quietly recategorizing works from Russian to Ukrainian         Skochilenko has been kept in pretrial detention since April 2022, a period of time in which her health has been deteriorating, according to the independent investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta.            In her last statement in court prior to the announcement of the verdict on Thursday, Skochilenko questioned the perceived threat posed by her actions, stating, “How little faith does our prosecutor have in our state and society if he believes that our statehood and public safety can be destroyed by five small pieces of paper?”           Describing herself as a pacifist, Skochilenko said she did not understand the purpose of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. “Today, scientists and doctors around the world are fighting to increase human life expectancy and find cures for deadly diseases. Therefore, I don’t understand: what is (this) war for? War shortens lives. War is death,” she added, according to a courtroom correspondent for the independent news outlet Mediazona.     Russian forces almost destroyed this Ukrainian artist’s work. Now it’s becoming a global symbol of peace         Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, Marie Struthers, condemned the conviction.           In a statement, Struthers decried the “manifestly unjust verdict,” highlighting that Skochilenko had been “arbitrarily deprived of her freedom and held in torturous conditions for 19 months.”           Skochilenko “was simply trying to expose … Russian aggression against the people of Ukraine,” Struthers continued. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

She had kept the rare artwork – which she thought was a Greek religious icon – in her kitchen.           The unsuspecting owner of the piece did not know where the 10-inch by 8-inch painting had come from, said Jerome Montcouquil of art specialists Cabinet Turquin, which was asked to carry out tests on the painting following its discovery, at the time.           The painting, which dates from 1280, went on to fetch almost 24.2 million euros ($26.8 million) at auction in October 2019, more than four times the pre-sale estimate.           But the French government then stepped in to block its export, assigning the painting “national treasure” status.           The move kept the tiny, ultra-rare painting in the country for 30 months, during which time the government raised the funds to buy it for the nation.           Now, France’s minister of culture, Rima Abdul Malak, and the president and director of the Louvre Museum, Laurence des Cars, have announced that the painting forms part of the museum’s collection.     A $26M Cimabue masterpiece was found in an elderly woman’s kitchen. Now France is blocking its export         “These acquisitions are the result of an exceptional mobilization of the Louvre Museum which allows to preserve in France works coveted by the greatest museums of the world and to make them accessible to all,” said the ministry in a statement, without providing any further details on how the money was raised.           The ministry went on to call the painting “a crucial milestone in art history, marking the fascinating transition from icon to painting.”           Only around 15 of Cimabue’s works are known, which is why the painting “is a national treasure of major importance,” adds the ministry.           It will join the much larger Cimabue painting “Maestà” in the Louvre collection, and both works will be part of an exhibition event in spring 2025, according to the ministry.     Medieval masterpiece found in French kitchen sells for over $26M         Cimabue is the pseudonym of artist Cenni di Pepo, born in Florence around the year 1240. He is known to have been the discoverer and master of Giotto, widely regarded as one of the greatest artists of the pre-Renaissance era.           “Christ Mocked” is part of a diptych comprising eight scenes centered on the passion and crucifixion of Christ.           The National Gallery in London is home to another scene from the work, “The Virgin and Child with Two Angels,” which the gallery acquired in 2000. It had been lost for centuries, before a British aristocrat found it in his ancestral home in Suffolk, according to AFP.           Another, “The Flagellation of Christ,” can be found at the Frick Collection in New York.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

But the authors’ coordinated statement also underscored tensions within the literary community — upon learning that a group of awards finalists planned to make a statement about the war, two sponsors decided not to attend the ceremony, The New York Times reported.           Zibby Owens, owner of Zibby Media, wrote in a Substack essay ahead of the ceremony that her company decided to withdraw its support and attendance after she learned the authors planned to “collectively band together to use their speeches to promote a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israeli agenda.” She added that she felt the event would promote discrimination against Israel and the Jewish people.           The subscription service Book of the Month, which remained a sponsor, told CNN in a statement that it did not attend the ceremony, but continued to support the event.           It’s not unusual for political statements to feature at the National Book Awards, as the National Book Foundation noted in its own statement ahead of the event.           Aside from the finalists’ comments about the Israel-Hamas war, several speakers and authors used their platforms at the awards ceremony to address efforts to ban books in US schools and libraries.     LeVar Burton, a children’s author and former host of the iconic TV program “Reading Rainbow,” emceed the awards ceremony and opened with a joke.           “Before we get going, are there any Moms for Liberty in the house?” he asked, referring to a conservative group behind recent attempts to remove certain books from school shelves. “No? Good. Then hands will not need to be thrown tonight.”           In his opening speech, Burton alluded to the climate in which book banning attempts are taking place.           “It was my mother who taught me at a very young age that if you can read in at least one language, you are, by her definition, free. And that idea of freedom feels especially fraught in this global political moment,” he said. “There are wars and rumors of wars and the machineries of war at work. On the home front, we are fighting for control of truth and how we interpret truth in this country. Books are being banned, words are being silenced and writers and others who champion books are under attack. “           Oprah Winfrey, who was celebrated as the ceremony’s special guest, drew attention to people who have been targeted for pushing back against book banning attempts. She quoted Barbara Kingsolver and Tess Gunty, and name-checked Abraham Verghese and Amanda Gorman, among other authors.           She also spoke about the importance of reading books by diverse authors, sharing how Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” had a profound impact on her as a 15-year-old.           “That book gave a voice to my silences, my secrets. It gave words to my pain and my confusion of being raped at 9 years old,” she said. “Until ‘Caged Bird’ I didn’t know that there was a language, there were words, for what had happened to me or that any other human being on earth had experienced it. That’s the power of books.”           At the end of her speech, Oprah said she hoped children would be able to see themselves in the pages of books, and consequently, be able to see others more clearly, too.           “Make no mistake: To ban books is to snuff out the flames of truth, of what it means to be alive, what it means to be aware, what it means to be engaged in the world. To ban books is to cut us off from one another, to shroud us in a solitary darkness, a soulless echo chamber,” she said. “To ban books is to strangle off what sustains us and makes us better people.”           Wednesday’s National Book Awards winners reflected a diverse array of subjects.           Justin Torres won the fiction award for “Blackouts,” an experimental novel that blends queer history and fiction to depict a deathbed conversation between two gay men.

style,A Texas museum acquired this masterpiece for $26M. But the Louvre wants to keep it in France,https://edition.cnn.com/style/chardin-louvre-kimbell-museum-strawberries/index.html,"       When the Kimbell Art Museum secured Jean Siméon Chardin’s “The Basket of Wild Strawberries” at auction for almost 24.4 million euros ($26.4 million) last March, the Texas institution expected the painting to join its small but valuable collection of European masterpieces.           But a month later, France’s culture ministry denied the 18th-century artwork an export license and designated it a “national treasure” — status that gave the country’s national collections two and a half years to purchase it by matching the winning bid.           Now, with less than four months left and 1.3 million euros ($1.4 million) still to raise, the Louvre Museum is turning to the public to keep the oil painting in France.           The Paris institution last week launched a fundraising campaign to help acquire a work it describes as “the quintessence of Chardin’s oeuvre.” Having already raised a significant portion of the money — including 15 million euros ($16.3 million) pledged by LVMH, owner of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. — the Louvre is calling for public donations before the export ban expires in February.           At the time of publication, the campaign had raised 20% of the required sum from over 2,000 donors. Potential patrons are being offered various perks in return, including private tours to view the painting and invites to a museum cocktail reception.           Chardin is widely heralded as being one of the greatest ever still life artists. Produced around 1760, the painting centers on a pyramid of strawberries in a wicker basket. It is one of several celebrated works by the French painter that depict fruits including plums and peaches.     Danish artist who submitted blank canvases as ‘art’ ordered to repay museum         The 18-inch-wide work was put on sale by a descendant of the 19th-century art collector Eudoxe Marcille, according to auction house ArtCurial, which handled the 2022 sale.           Initially expected to attract bids up to 15 million euros ($16.2 million), the painting was eventually won by the Kimbell Art Museum, which was founded in Fort Worth, Texas in 1972. The institution’s collection of over 300 artworks currently includes Michelangelo’s first known painting, “The Torment of Saint Anthony” and paintings by several major French artists, including Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin.           The Texas museum already has one other Chardin work in its collection. The Louvre, meanwhile, has more than 40, though the Paris institution described “The Basket of Wild Strawberries” as being “the last (painting) of its quality to remain in private hands.”           “Its entry into the national collections would masterfully complete the unique ensemble already presented at the Louvre Museum, the most important by this painter in the world,” said Louvre director Laurence des Cars in press release, describing the painting as “imbued with the poetry of senses.”     Italy repatriates looted ancient artifacts from the US         In a statement emailed to CNN, the Kimbell Art Museum’s director Eric M. Lee appeared to accept that his institution would never be able to complete the purchase. “While I’m sorry that the painting will not find its home at the Kimbell, I’m delighted that this masterpiece of French painting will be on view for the public at the Louvre,” he said.           Lee was unavailable for further comment. But he earlier told the New York Times: “I agree that the painting is a national treasure of France. But I also believe that it is a world treasure and could serve as an ambassador of French culture.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

style,Trans activist Raquel Willis is in full bloom,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/15/style/raquel-willis-the-risk-it-takes-to-bloom-memoir-cec/index.html," Editor’s Note: Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.         Raquel Willis has spent more than a decade working as both a journalist and activist for Black and LGBTQ people, championing these causes and uplifting voices. Now, she’s ready to share her own story.           “The Risk It Takes to Bloom: On Life and Liberation” is Willis’ first book, exploring her journey into her own womanhood as a transgender person, navigating Southern Catholic family dynamics, social justice work and transphobia both in the media and in real life. Across its pages, readers are transported alongside Willis’ life, growing and blooming with her at every step of the way.           The book has been building inside Willis since the early 2010s, she said, but she didn’t feel ready to share it with the world. Now, that’s changed.           “A lot of the conversations we were having about systems of oppression, particularly in the summer of 2020, brought all the conventions of White supremacy and the cisheteropatriarchy more into the fore for a lot of people,” Willis said in a phone interview. “So I also felt that perhaps the world was more primed to hear what I had to say in this way.”           “The Risk It Takes to Bloom” derives its title from a line written by Elizabeth Appell: “And the day came when the risk to remain closed in a bud became more painful than the risk it took to blossom.”           For Willis, who first heard the line in the intro to the 2009 Alicia Keys album “The Element of Freedom,” the words specifically connected to the way she felt about gendered expectations at the time — the idea of being painfully enclosed in a bud, rather than being allowed to be free and blossom.           “The idea of blooming really matched up with the points in my life when I decided that my silence was not going to help me grow,” she said.           Her life, she said, has been full of moments of blossoming: From coming out to her family as gay as a teen and, later, as a transgender woman, to the death of transgender 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn. Even in the wake of tragedy, Willis bloomed, embracing her identity and staying true to herself.           Willis hopes readers will be encouraged to do the same, but she recognizes that many people may struggle. People are sometimes afraid of what they may lose when claiming aspects of their identity, like “the woman who feels like her gender is only a liability” or an employee who hides certain parts of themselves to get ahead.           “Many of us are hungry for validation and we are often made to feel like validation can only come by fulfilling expectations even when they don’t fit us anymore,” Willis said. “I had to make a conscious decision, particularly into owning my trans-ness, to understand that there was no amount of validation that was going to come to me if I tried to live this cis-het life, or this cis-gay life at that point, that would fulfill me.”           Sure, she might have had more social acceptance, Willis said. But she wouldn’t have been moving with dignity.           “The Risk It Takes to Bloom” is being released at a time when the rights of transgender people are hotly contested among lawmakers, and violence against transgender people — especially Black transgender women — is on the rise. Trans people are perhaps more visible than ever, while Americans are more aware of how dynamics of race, gender and sexuality play out in our lives.           “Revolution isn’t a singular event but a continuously unfolding phenomenon,” Willis writes in the book. In spite of everything happening in the world, liberation is still possible.           “Trans voices are so necessary to disrupt these ideas of who we consider to be valid and who we consider to be normal and who we consider to be worthy,” she said.           The memoir is just Willis’ latest opportunity to do that. But it’s not just for transgender people; cisgender people are “bound by gender all the time,” she said. Cisgender boys and men are told they can’t cry or like the color pink, and cisgender girls and women are told they can’t be strong or capable leaders.           “In some way, we’re all gender nonconforming,” Willis said. “All of us fail to meet these ideas of manhood, masculinity, womanhood and femininity.”           Below, Willis shares other works that influenced her memoir, or works that she feels her book is in conversation with.     Read: “Hiding My Candy” by The Lady Chablis — The Lady Chablis was the most well-known transgender actress in the 1990s, made famous by the book “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.” Born in Florida, her story takes her all over the South, eventually finding a home in Savannah, Georgia. Willis called the 1996 book “the last major Black Southern trans memoir,” a direct relative of Willis’ own work.     Read: “Wrapped in Rainbows” by Valerie Boyd — This biography of Zora Neale Hurston was written by one of Willis’ mentors, who died while she was writing “The Risk It Takes to Bloom.” Both “Hiding My Candy” and this book “utilize dialect in a way that’s really important to me,” Willis said.           “I had small moments in ‘Bloom’ that do that, but I think their use of African American Vernacular English really gives me life.”     Listen: “The Velvet Rope” by Janet Jackson — Released in 1997, Jackson’s sixth album “really delves into some taboo topics,” Wilis said, and “talks about queerness explicitly.” The singer received a GLAAD Media Award for the album, and her song “Together Again” is an ode to the people she lost to the AIDS epidemic. And the music video for Willis’ favorite song off the album, “Got ‘Til It’s Gone,” is set during apartheid in South Africa.           “There’s so many layered meanings there around Blackness, around nonconformity, that I appreciate in that album,” she said.     Listen: “The Age of Pleasure” by Janelle Monáe — Monáe’s fourth album mingles sounds from across the Black diaspora, and while it was only just released this year, after the writing of the memoir was complete, the work connects with Willis’ own.           “I saw (Monáe) in concert in Brooklyn about a month or so ago, and it was just a beautiful space where queerness and transness and uniqueness was prioritized and celebrated,” she said. “The voice was on point, the outfits, the body, the beauty, the sounds, of course, were everything.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.
